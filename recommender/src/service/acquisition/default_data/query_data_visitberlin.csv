1,Deutsches Theater Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/deutsches-theater-berlin,"

  The acclaimed Deutsches Theater Berlin ensemble presents classics and cutting-edge contemporary theatre – with English surtitles for some productions. 
  
Tickets
The perfect way to start an evening at the theatre – strolling across a spreading square, enjoying the elegant neo-classical architecture. The impressive façade of the Deutsches Theater Berlin is to the right and the Kammerspiele, dating from the early twentieth century, to the left. The centrally located Deutsches Theater restaurant is also ideal for relaxing before or after a show.
The theatre’s repertoire includes both traditional and modern classics from Chekhov to Sartre, Ibsen and Goethe – as well as many works by contemporary playwrights. Under artistic director Ulrich Khuon, the Deutsches Theater Berlin has also expanded its commitment to contemporary theatre, staging works by such modern playwrights as  Lukas Bärfuß, Dea Loher, Wolfram Lotz, Roland Schimmelpfennig, Ferdinand Schmalz and Nis-Momme Stockmann, and presenting many of these productions as world premières. Every spring, the Deutsches Theater also hosts the two-week Autorentheatertage festival of contemporary drama, underlining its aim of providing a new impetus to enrich modern German theatre.
The Deutsches Theater’s success only goes to confirm its approach. The Deutsches Theatre has frequently been invited to present its productions at the prestigious Theatertreffen festival. The Deutsches Theater and the Baracke des DT were already voted as theater of the year three times in the critics'' survey of the theater magazine '"Theater heute'". The Deutsches Theatre productions and the ensemble have won an array of prizes including, in October 2013, artistic director Ulrich Khuon’s award of the esteemed Max-Reinhardt-Ring, presented by the German Association of Stage Workers (GDBA).
The theatre has particularly supported collaborations with directors with distinctive styles, such as Andreas Kriegenburg, Stephan Kimmig, Stefan Pucher, Michael Thalheimer and Tom Kühnel/Jürgen Kuttner. The ensemble also includes many prominent actors in German theatre and media from Corinna Harfouch and Maren Eggert to Samuel Finzi, Susanne Wolff, Ulrich Matthes and Bernd Stempel.
In 1883, the Schumannstraße building became the home of the highly-acclaimed Deutsches Theater ensemble. Constructed in 1850 as the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Städtisches Theater, the stage was originally home to comedies and operettas. In contrast, the Deutsches Theater, founded by theatre critic Adolph L’Arronge, increasingly presented straight theatre, and has successfully retained that focus ever since.
The intimate auditorium of the main stage, which dates back to 1850, provides seating for 600. In 1906, then artistic director Max Reinhardt established the Kammerspiele in the neighbouring building. Specifically intended for modern drama, the Kammerspiele can seat audiences of up to 230. In 2006, the Deutsches Theater then added the Box, a third stage specifically for young directors to present new works and topical subjects. The compact black box stage, located in the Kammerspiele foyer, has around 80 seats.

2,Volksbühne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/volksbuhne-am-rosa-luxemburg-platz,"

  The Volksbühne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz – leading German film actors, experimental theatre and provocative productions, some even with English surtitles!
  
Tickets
The Volksbühne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz has a long tradition of bringing together well-known actors and experimental theatre – and is equally well known for its provocative productions, creating some major scandals in theatre history. The theatre not only stages its own productions, but has a number of long-standing cooperations, for instance, with the Gob Squad, a British-German collective based in Nottingham and Berlin. The major names regularly appearing at present on the stage of the Volksbühne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz include film actor Henry Hübchen as well as Alexander Scheer, Martin Wuttke, Sophie Rois and many others.
Aside from provocative and widely discussed critical explorations of contemporary issues and multimedia adaptations of novels, the productions by Christoph Marthaler, Christoph Schlingensief (†), Dimiter Gotscheff and René Pollesch have really made waves.
In line with the Volksbühne’s ‘expanded concept of theatre’, the programme also includes concerts, screenings, readings and literary events – which sometimes involves turning the theatre cafeteria into an unusual location for rehearsals or even a provisional stage!
In 1992, Frank Castorf was appointed as the Volksbühne’s artistic director. Under his directorship, the Volksbühne was voted twice as the theater of the year in the critics'' survey of the theater magazine '"Theater heute'". Klaus dörr currently holds the position of interim director of the theatre.
In addition to the theatre’s main auditorium, the Volksbühne has a number of venues and in-house stages, including the Roter and Grüner Salon and the Sternenfoyer, as well as a stage on the third floor and the more intimate Hinterbühne stage.
The Volksbühne, designed by Oskar Kaufmann, dates from 1914. Erwin Piscator, artistic director in the 1920s, was renowned for his controversial productions. His approach to theatre was also an important influence on Bertolt Brecht. During the Second World War, the theatre building was almost completely destroyed. In the early 1950s in what was then East Germany, the theatre was redesigned by Hans Richter and rebuilt. In East Germany, the Volksbühne developed into a modern director’s theatre, staging plays by prestigious writers such as Heiner Müller, and noted for its provocative productions by Benno Besson and Fritz Marquardt.
Some performances have English surtitles. For more details, check the programme in advance.
In the area around the Volksbühne, there is only limited parking.

3,Maxim Gorki Theater | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/maxim-gorki-theater,"

  At the Maxim Gorki Theatre, you don’t just sit in the audience – you join in the debate and have your say! Experience contemporary theatre at its best.
  
Tickets
Down on Unter den Linden boulevard, in the heart of Berlin, Maxim Gorki Theatre has a mission – turning the spotlight on social changes and upheavals, both on stage as well as off. The 17-person ensemble around in-house directors Nurkan Erpulat, Sebastian Nübling and Yael Ronen has developed a powerful repertoire of literary premières, contemporary works and research projects.
The Я [ya] in GOЯKI is the last letter in the Russian alphabet, and it also means ‘I’ – which is eminently appropriate since the Maxim Gorki Theatre stands for self-definition and self-determination. This approach is vibrantly alive in Studio Я, the studio stage, with discussions, concerts and projects under artistic director Marianna Salzmann, who is also the in-house author.
The Gorki X – School, Club and Laboratory also plays a key role here as well, since it stands for free space in all its many facets. Gorki X is open for everyone from amateurs to professionals to join in, have their say, and experiment. The focus is not just on staging encounters in and with theatre, but also critically exploring the world around us, the world we live in. It’s a big topic, and encourages big discussions – which can be wonderfully continued in the theatre cafeteria!
Tip: Before starting your evening at the Maxim Gorki Theatre, check out the Gorki theatre column at http://kolumne.gorki.de/.
The Maxim Gorki Theatre is one of Berlin’s municipal theatres – and so artistic directors Shermin Langhoff and Jens Hillje seek to ensure that this stage is right at the heart of the city, not only geographically. Shermin Langhoff had already founded post-migrant theatre at the arts centre Ballhaus Naunynstraße – an approach she has further expanded since she became artistic director at the theatre in the 2013/14 season.
The Maxim Gorki Theatre celebrates diversity – from roots to religions, gender and identities. And to ensure that the audiences are just as diverse as the plays and topics on stage, all productions have English surtitles from the second performance on.
The Gorki brings onto the stage all those contemporary issues and themes long missing in modern theatre – an approach that has definitely borne fruit. The Maxim Gorki Theater has already been voted the theater of the year twice in the critics'' survey of the theater magazine '"Theater heute'", one of Germany’s leading theatre magazines. Since then, for two consecutive years Gorki productions have been invited to take part in the prestigious Theatertreffen festival (Common Ground, 2015, The Situation, 2016). The Gorki has won a series of other awards, confirming its commitment to its present course and development.
In 1827, a concert hall for the Berliner Singakademie choral society was the original building on this site. But the concert hall, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, probably Berlin’s most famous architect, was severely damaged in the Second World War. The neo-classical building was rebuilt in the post-war years and opened as a straight theatre venue.
Founded in 1952 in then East Berlin, the Maxim Gorki Theatre was dedicated to contemporary theatre. Initially, the programme focused on Russian and Soviet realist productions, but the Gorki also staged the world premières of Heiner Müller’s Die Korrektur (The Correction) or Alfred Matusche’s Nacktes Gras. Over the years, the Maxim Gorki Theatre increasingly developed a stage programme critically engaging with contemporary issues and concerns – a spirit that still guides the theatre today.

4,Berliner Ensemble | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berliner-ensemble,"

  The Berliner Ensemble is renowned for its outstanding German-language productions – and a tradition embracing many great names in German theatre!
  

The impressive auditorium, with its red seating and elaborate decorative carvings, epitomises the best in stage traditions. The third bell rings, the house lights dim and, as the heavy red curtain slowly opens, the audience falls silent. An actor walks out onto stage and pauses briefly – as if savouring the moment before the drama unfolds.
The Berliner Ensemble was established in East Berlin in 1949 by leading playwright, poet and theatre director Bertolt Brecht and his wife, the distinguished actress Helene Weigel. Their artistic and political beliefs fundamentally shaped this ensemble’s traditions. Even today, the repertoire ranges from the great German-language classics – whether Goethe’s famous '"Faust'" or Lessing’s '"Nathan der Weise'" – to contemporary works by Heiner Müller or Christa Wolf. Many of the plays have a strong political message, including Brecht’s own works such as the '"Kaukasische Kreidekreis'" (The Caucasian Chalk Circle) or '"Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder'" (Mother Courage and her Children). And if you’re wondering why German theatre has such an enviable reputation, then the Berliner Ensemble is a great place to find out! You can regularly choose from up to 15 performances a month, including such classics as:
Here, you can also see German-language productions of such well-known plays as Shakespeare’s '"Was Ihr wollt'" (Twelfth Night) or Beckett’s '"Warten auf Godot'" (Waiting for Godot).
From the very start, the Berliner Ensemble was housed in a key venue in the history of the stage, associated with such major figures as Max Reinhardt, Bertolt Brecht, Helene Weigel, Heiner Müller and Claus Peymann. The Theater am Schiffbauerdamm opened in 1893 with the première of Gerhart Hauptmann’s '"Die Weber'". In 1954, this theatre then became home to the Berliner Ensemble. From 1999 to 2017, the Berliner Ensemble’s artistic director was Claus Peymann. His vision revitalised the Berliner Ensemble as a venue for political theatre, taking as its motto Schiller’s immortal words: “Theatre as a moral institution”. From the 2017|18 season Oliver Reese, former artistic director of the Staatsschauspiel Frankfurt, is the artistic director of the theatre.
Take a look backstage and in the wings! At open events, the artistic director, stage directors and performers answer questions from the audience, including, for example: Are actors always nervous before each performance? How often do you rehearse a new piece before the première? How do the technical aspects of the performance work? For more details on a particular play, dramatic advisers present a brief talk 45 minutes before the curtain rises, offering an insight into how the play was created.
The theatre offers reduced tickets for school pupils. Tickets for school pupils cost € 9 for all performances, and as little as € 4.50 for shows marked as selected for schools.
Tip: For a taste of life backstage - and perhaps a chat with one of the actors – why not get the real deal at the Berliner Ensemble canteen? During the daytime, or before or after a show, there’s more on offer than just pea soup or bratwurst – and it even has a small beer garden for summer!

5,Hebbel am Ufer HAU 1-3 | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/hebbel-am-ufer-hau-1-3,"

  For avant-garde on stage, you can see the latests movements in theatre, dance and performance at the three theatres of the Hebbel Am Ufer.
  
Tickets
HAU1, HAU2 and HAU3 are the names of the three different stages where the Hebbel am Ufer group of theatres performs contemporary dance, theatre and performance. Whether on the big stage in the Hebbel theatre or on the small one HAU 3, the productions are always fascinating examples of the latest in theatre and dance. The programme also includes music, visual arts and discussions.
Annemie Vanackere has been artistic director since 2012, and she and her team seek forms of artistic expression for the current social and political situation. The group does not have its own ensemble; instead it invites theatre groups to perform ambitious productions of high artistic quality. International co-productions and projects of the Berlin and (inter)national theatre and dance scene are developed and performed here.
Vanackere’s strategy continues that of the previous artistic directors Nele Hertling – who from 1989 to 2003 quickly turned what was then called the Hebbel-Theater from an empty building to an internationally renowned venue – and Matthias Lilienthal, under whose stewardship it wons the Federal Republic of Germany’s Design Prize in 2007 for its corporate design. The Hebbel am Ufer has already been voted the theater of the year twice in the critical review of the theater magazine '"Theater heute'".
HAU1 is in the former Hebbel-Theater in Kreuzberg, which looks back on a long history, having been built in the early 20th century in the Art Nouveau style. It is a narrow building in a row of houses. The unostentatious but stylish wood-panelled auditorium has a number of boxes. The Hebbel-Theater was the only theatre that survived the second world war without major damage.
WAU at the HAU
Not just for premieres and festivals – the WAU at the HAU Hebbel is a café in the mornings, a canteen at lunchtime and in the evenings a restaurant with regional and Mediterranean cuisine.
HAU2 was once the home to the legendary productions of the Schaubühne am Halleschen Ufer, before the theatre group moved to the Mendelsohn-Bau on Lehniner Platz in Charlottenburg in 1981. For the next ten years it hosted the Theatermanufaktur am Halleschen Ufer. In 1992 it was repurposed as the main venue for independent theatre groups in Berlin, and has since then also become one of the main venues for dance theatre.
The smallest theatre is HAU3, a courtyard stage with space for only 100 people. In the 1990s, the Polish director Andrej Woron’s Teatr Kreatur played here.
The venues are located in three different buildings in close proximity to each other:
Tickets: HEBBEL AM UFER – HAU 1: Stresemannstr. 29 in 10963 Berlin
Tickets: HEBBEL AM UFER – HAU 2: Hallesches Ufer 32 in 10963 Berlin
Tickets: HEBBEL AM UFER – HAU 3: Tempelhofer Ufer 10 in 10963 Berlin
Perhaps the perfect time to appreciate the area around the HAU is on a sunny Sunday when the streets and parks are full of people taking a walk or just sitting in the cafés enjoying the sun. The spacious park at Gleisdreieck with all its sporting facilities gives the area a truly recreational atmosphere.

7,Renaissance-Theater - visitberlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/renaissance-theater,"

  International contemporary drama and critical examination of present topics are what make the Renaissance-Theater so exciting. 
  
Tickets
Berlin’s Renaissance-Theater on Knesebeckstraße in Charlottenburg is the only fully surviving Art Deco theatre in Europe. Its focus under the artistic directorship of Horst-H. Filohn is on international contemporary drama, and its schedule is dominated by national and international premieres of works by prize-winning playwrights.
As well as the main productions you can attend readings and events such as the literary excursions, where biographies and new publications are presented, as well as musical and literary programmes in the Bruckner Foyer.
In recent years, plays such as Der letzte Vorhang with Suzanne von Borsody and Entartete Kunst – Der Fall Cornelius Gurlitt were very well received.
The 2016/2017 season will see top-ranking actors such as Katharina Thalbach, Boris Aljinović and Guntbert Warns on the stage.
Thanks to its many tours of German-speaking countries, the Renaissance-Theater’s productions are highly regarded outside Berlin too.
The Renaissance-Theater began in 1922 with Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s Miss Sara Sampson. Its first director was the Austrian author Theodor Tagger, who under the pseudonym Ferdinand Bruckner became one of the most successful dramatists of the Weimar Republic.
During the Nazi period the theatre had to close, but it opened again shortly after the end of the war. With a combination of literary sophistication and entertainment, the theatre succeeded in establishing itself as a stage for the very best actors, and Helene Weigel, Otto Sander, Curt Goetz and many others have appeared on its stage.
Several years after the theatre was founded, the interior furnishings of the now-listed building were converted by the renowned architect Oskar Kaufmann in the Art Deco style of the 1920s with elements of rococo and expressionism. As well as the red rosewood panelling and the variety of decorative forms, one of the most striking objects is the auditorium’s large intarsia mural with motives of the Commedia dell’Arte. This jewel of theatrical architecture is something which has to be seen.

8,Theater an der Parkaue - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/theater-der-parkaue,"
The Theater an der Parkaue is Germany’s biggest theatre for children and young people and is situated in a listed building complex in the Lichtenberg district of Berlin. The theatre currently has three stages with more than 600 seats altogether.
The repertoire has grown to include more than 35 plays for different ages. The very youngest are introduced to the theatre with imagination and playful enthusiasm. There are also special performances for children of 10 years and older, and youth theatre for teenagers.
The repertoire at the Theater an der Parkaue includes stories from overseas, myths from the past, fairy tales that everyone knows, new translations, familiar old plays and classics from more than 2000 years of literature. These include adaptations of well-known plays such as Friedrich Schiller’s The Robbers for young people of 15 and older, as well as German and world premieres, such as The Wizard Of Oz, which has been on the programme since June 2016. It gives the young audience a fun introduction to the varied world of theatre.
Stages 1 and 2 are currently undergoing extensive renovation, so the Theater an der Parkaue is packing its bags to play at other exciting places in Berlin. These include the Prater in Kastanienallee, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW), the Kulturhaus Karlshorst and the Tischlerei der Deutschen Oper Berlin.
The original Z-shaped complex was built in 1911 and designed by the city’s chief of public works Johannes Uhlig and the architect Wilhelm Grieme. The Renaissance-inspired building was first used as a boys’ high school. In 1934 it was renamed the Joseph-Goebbels-Schule and survived the war almost unharmed. After the war, it was converted to the children’s branch of the House of Culture of the Soviet Union, and until German reunification in 1990 it was a “Pioneer house” with up to 130 working groups for children and young people. In 1991 Manuel Schöbel became the youngest artistic director in Germany. His first season included seven premieres. Today the theatre is headed by Kay Wuschek.
On the theatre’s website, material for teachers and a pocket theatre are available for free. Classes up to Year 6 pay €6.50 per ticket, and from Year 7 they pay €8. There are special rates for schools in Berlin.
Restored 19th century buildings, renovated tower blocks and a varied infrastructure make this area an exciting prospect. The ongoing modernisation is attracting young creative people who are breathing life into established cultural institutions such as the Theater an der Parkaue.

9,GRIPS Theater - visitberlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/grips-theater,"

  The GRIPS is a streetwise theatre for young and old, where everyday problems are skilfully explored on stage. The team initiates many projects for schools.
  

Since the 1960s the GRIPS theatre in Mitte has been a creative pioneer, developing modern and contemporary plays for children and young people.
The concept developed by its founder Volker Ludwig was a complete success. He wanted to show real life, to offer young people prospects in life and to encourage them. What makes the theatre so popular is that it presents real problems in an artistic context. Its plays have been performed around the world over 1800 times in 50 countries and 40 languages.
Every year, the GRIPS theatre comes up with new ideas, performing four or five completely new plays. However, its repertoire also includes a number of old favourites which it constantly revisits with a fresh touch. These include Adams Welt, about a child who creates a life of his own in his imagination. With his own music, landscapes and underwater worlds, Adam takes us through his childhood dream.
Although the focus is usually on children and young people, there are also plays for adults. These include the cult musical Linie 1 about passengers on the (West) Berlin underground, ranging from Wilmersdorf widows to Kreuzberg punks. Since 2012, the programme for adults also includes Frau Müller muss weg, Lutz Hübner’s comedy about a parents’ evening, in a wonderful, lovingly directed production by the film-maker Sönke Wortmann.
As well as the main venue, the GRIPS theatre also has a smaller studio stage in the Podewil theatre on Klosterstraße.
There’s a lot going on off stage too. The GRIPS theatre pedagogy team researches phenomena and stories from childhood and youth, with the aim of exploring social topics using artistic means.
The theatre offers workshops and training courses, and maintains contacts with various initiatives and partners such as the August Bebel Institute and Jugendliche ohne Grenzen. There are also projects for schools and nurseries. The GRIPS theatre is bursting with energy and commitment! 
To make children’s and young people’s visit something lasting and special, experts from the GRIPS theatre help classes analyse what they have seen and experienced. In a playful way, scenes are analysed, and impressions are discussed and explored. The GRIPS team comes directly to schools in Berlin, while pupils from Brandenburg can look forward to a visit to the theatre.

  Visit Theater Strahl and take advantage of the offerings for Berlin schools. The pieces are often wordless and easy for all to understand.
  

'"When I grow up, I''m going to be an astronaut.'" Many children formulate their dreams in such simple and clear language, but the path to outer space is rarely directly and without detours. As they grow up, kids often encounter challenges and are confronted with individual fears that make them doubt themselves and their plans.
Theater Strahl is dedicated to addressing this whirlwind of emotions. Classic pieces by the likes of Shakespeare and Wedekind are checked for current relevance and translated into the emotional language of today''s youth.
The pieces are suitable for kids ages 12 and older. All tickets can be ordered directly via the website. The regular ticket price for schoolchildren is €7.50. Adults pay €16 or €10 with any of the usual discounts. People on benefit can get tickets for just €3 on the day before the scheduled performance. Just bring your ID.
School groups can also sign up to attend open rehearsals and meet the actors after performances. With the support of JugendKulturService GmbH, Berlin school classes and youth organisations receive discounts, paying only €6 per ticket for students, teachers, and chaperones.
The schedule includes special productions like the piece Klasse Tour, designed especially for kids on a school outing. With a wink of the eye, the actors tell their own experiences that are sure to awaken a memory or two among the audience. The pantomime paired with beat-box elements makes the group''s prices readily understandable, even by groups with limited or no skills in German.
The theatre appreciates artistic exchange and takes its shows regularly on the road to a variety of venues in Germany. and to such countries as Spain, Turkey, France, the Netherlands, Finland, Russia, and Israel.

14,Theater im Palais - visitberlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/theater-im-palais,"

  Located in the heart of the city, old classics and new Berlin stories get their moment in the spotlight on the small stage at Theater im Palais. 
  
Tickets
The stage is just 5 by 6 metres and there are only 99 seats in the house. The grand ambience in such a small space creates a sophisticated and intimate atmosphere for each performance at Theater im Palais. Right in the heart of Berlin. The company has played at the Palais am Festungsgraben since its very beginning, behind Schinkel''s Neue Wache and around the corner from Unter den Linden. Major institutions like he Maxim Gorki Theater, the State Opera, and the German Historical Museum are all just around the corner, too. 
The history of Theater im Palais
Founded in 1991 in the Palais am Festungsgraben, the company continues to perform chamber theatre in this former palace. The palace was built in 1753 for Johann Gottfried Donner, Frederick the Great''s personal valet. Today it is a listed building.
From theater classics to Berlin stories 
The theatre''s repertoire is diverse, but traditional with the primary focus on the authors. Classic pieces by the likes of Goethe, Schiller, and Shakespeare are regularly performed on the small stage. In addition, literary adaptations of stories by Fontane, Heine, and E.T.A. Hoffmann are also performed. 
But the company never forgets its connection to Berlin, which is always a character in each production. After all, Berlin has countless stories to tell about the city, its residents, and its literary scene. Narrative, drama, and music are mixed in a completely unconventional way here, with productions often taking a self-deprecating look at Berlin. 
The Junges Ensemble at Theater im Palais
The Junges Ensemble has also made its home at Theater im Palais since 2006. Although the performers are young, their pieces are for young and old. They have since performed more than 30 pieces under the ensemble''s professional leadership, covering topics ranging from love to football.

  Theaterdiscounter showcases contemporary interpretations of classic stage plays. It even offers a loyalty card, where every sixth visit is free.
  
Tickets
If there''s a recipe for contemporary theatre, Theaterdiscounter seems to have found it.
The schedule is peppered with reinterpretations of classic pieces as well as experimental projects and performances. The directors tell well-known stories in unconventional ways and are always making use of new forms of staging. The list of ingredients for each piece always includes a bit of willingness to break out of the box of traditional theatre.
Theaterdiscounter was founded in 2003 as an independent theatre on Oranienburger Straße in Berlin''s Mitte district. In early 2009, the ensemble moved to its present venue in the former East Berlin telephone exchange office near Alexanderplatz. The theatre specialises in rapid turnaround times, taking only a few weeks from the germ of an idea to be ready for opening night. The pieces are produced in such a way that gets them before the customer as quickly and affordably as possible, just like the grocery discount chains that inspired the theatre''s name. In the end, the quality''s there even if the piece has come together in less than a month.

19,Neuköllner Oper - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/neukollner-oper,"

  The Neuköllner Oper brings you culture right up close – and international culture to boot. It was the home of the first German-Turkish musical theatre in Germany, and could not be more different to “normal” opera houses. 
  
Tickets
Ever since it was founded in 1977 the Neuköllner Oper has reflected of our contemporary history, and has long since acquired a respected reputation.
Back then, the Neuköllner Oper rehearsed in churches and factory buildings, before moving into an old ballroom in the former Rixdorf assembly rooms on Neukölln''s busy Karl-Marx-Straße in 1988.
Since then the company has staged modern interpretations of everything from baroque opera and musicals to operettas and experimental musical theatre.
The open musical theatre attracts national and international attention. It can proudly call itself the first German-Turkish musical theatre in the country and has now become an institution, putting on numerous projects, co-productions and festivals.
The private theatre is supported by the Berlin Senate, receiving subsidies for individual projects. Sources of funding include the capital city’s cultural fund, GASAG and the cultural foundation.
The Neuköllner Oper aims to combine fun with serious entertainment and good humour. It creates new plays and combines them with old values.
The NO is a contemporary, experimental institution. From new forms of musical theatre to musicals and operettas, there is always something new and surprising to experience: crossover productions, musical theatre for families, musical premieres and much more besides.
In just 36 years the Neuköllner Oper has celebrated more than 160 world premieres – making it the most productive musical theatre in Europe.
The Neuköllner Oper develops new plays in collaboration with the musical and show faculty of Berlin’s University of the Arts. This gives young actors a taste of life on stage and at the theatre. The project allows students to see how a play is developed and to experience all the challenges this presents. This valuable experience helps the young actors as they embark on their artistic careers.

21,Ballhaus Naunynstraße | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/ballhaus-naunynstrasse,"

  The Ballhaus Naunynstraße theatre, dating from 1983 has since become a hub of (post)migrant theatre in Germany.

Tickets
In 2008 the Ballhaus Naunynstraße was successfully reopened by Shermin Langhoff. The stage in the beautiful ballroom became a pivotal point of (post-)migrant theatre in Germany. The house relies on in-house and co-productions with international actors and directors. The artistic director Wagner Carvalho continues this focus and is particularly dedicated to the promotion of young talent.
The programme of the Ballhaus is complemented by a large number of interdisciplinary projects, film series, readings, concerts and local art education projects such as the Kiez-Monatsschau within the framework of the Akademie der autodidakten.
The Ballhaus Naunynstraße was opened in 1863 as a dance hall in a Wilhelminian style building in Berlin. After restrictions due to building regulations and problems with permits for the hall to be used for theatre performances, the owners change several times. Wilhelm and Elise Döring took over the hall in 1922 and gave the Ballhaus its name. Until the end of the 1930s it was used as a restaurant for private parties.
During the Nazi dictatorship, the '"imperial capital Berlin'" takes over the hall building and uses it to accommodate forced laborers. The house survives the war relatively undamaged and Elise Döring finally receives the official dance permit in 1949.
From 1961 the ballroom was more or less idle - the hall was closed, the building served as a warehouse.
Since 1983 the Ballhaus has been owned by the district office Friechrichshain-Kreuzberg. Since 2008-2012, the non-profit Kultursprünge e.V., with which the district office determined the use of the building, has been sponsored, and since 2013 the postmigrant theatre has been operated by Kultursprünge gemeinnützige GmbH. She designs the program in the Ballhaus Naunynstraße.

22,The Friedrichstadt-Palast - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/friedrichstadt-palast,"

  Friedrichstadt-Palast in the heart of Berlin is famed for its must-see grand shows, glitz and glamour – and all shows are ideal for international guests!
  
Tickets
Glamorous costumes, breathtaking stage settings, stunning dance routines and great music – the Friedrichstadt-Palast is the European location closest to the glitz of Las Vegas! The main auditorium, which can seat nearly 1900, is the largest show palace in Europe – and for that very special night out, also offers the sheer luxury of the Wall Sky Lounge complete with private bar. The Palast shows feature stunning dance routines with an ensemble totalling 60 dancers – including the world’s longest line of showgirls. To produce these breathtaking grand shows requires a full team. From dancers to musicians, acrobats, sound engineers, set construction and stage technicians as well as administrative staff, over 300 people are working on and behind the stage.
The shows create spectacular collages of music, dance and acrobatics with up to over 100 performers on stage at the same time. The Palast is equipped with the latest cutting-edge technologies, and can create any scene, from a water basin to an ice-rink or a circus ring. Moreover, it also has the largest laser show in Europe. And all so it can stage a breathtakingly opulent show every evening – and every show features the iconic Palast showgirls and their precision dance routines!
Since September 2018 you can experience all this in the latest show VIVID: a declaration of love for life. Philip Treacy, who has worked for Armani, Alexander McQueen, Karl Lagerfeld, Ralph Lauren and Valentino, is design director of the show and created the spectacular headdress design.
Today, the glamorous show theatre and the building itself are both known as the Friedrichstadt-Palast. The theatre’s roots, though, go back to a building originally some 200 metres away and designed in 1867 as a market hall. In 1873, six years later, the market hall was converted to create a permanent circus venue, large enough to hold an audience of several thousand. In 1919, after several new starts, the theatre building was taken over by impresario Max Reinhardt as a stage for monumental productions. Reinhardt renamed it the Großes Schauspielhaus – ’Grand Theatre’ – and ran it as a second venue along with his Deutsches Theater for serious drama. The Großes Schauspielhaus certainly lived up to its name during Berlin’s glorious 1920s when the venue hosted such internationally renowned acts as the Comedian Harmonists. During the later years of the Nazi era, the theatre was closed.
Only after the end of the Second World War and the division of Berlin was the theatre, then in East Berlin, named the Friedrichstadt-Palast. In East Germany, the venue hosted major national and international stars, including Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. In 1980, the building’s foundations were found to be in such poor condition that the theatre had to close its doors. A new Friedrichstadt-Palast was then constructed on the present site – on Friedrichstraße in the heart Berlin, where it still is today.
After German reunification, the Friedrichstadt-Palast soon advanced to become one of Europe’s top show stages, renowned for its breathtaking grand productions such as Yma, Show Me and The Wyld. Every February, the Palast has a shift of pace when it becomes Berlin’s largest cinema. For a few weeks, guests to the Berlinale, the city’s famous film festival, can then enjoy screenings of some of the top festival movies here.

23,Sasha Waltz & Guests | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/sasha-waltz-guests,"

  Dancing through the museum: the dance company Sasha Waltz & Guests is famous for its spectacular productions. 
  
Tickets
The ensemble Sasha Waltz & Guests is Berlin’s most important institution for contemporary dance, and has become known for its spectacular productions and sensational choreographies in empty spaces. At the opening of the Neues Museum, dancers went from room to room exploring the empty building. In the production of the opera Dido & Aeneas, they dive into a giant pool on the stage.
Thanks to her groundbreaking productions, Sasha Waltz is considered the most important innovator in contemporary dance. The ensemble not only specialises in its own productions, but now also in opera choreography.  As well as Dido & Aeneas, Sasha Waltz has produced other operas such as Berlioz’s Romeo et Juliette and Monteverdi’s Orfeo at major opera houses, finding new ways to combine music, singing and dance.Dialoge is an innovative series of projects where the audience can participate in the research for new pieces in preliminary studies. The openings of the Neues Museum, the Jüdisches Museum and the Radialsystem were also major Dialoge projects. In spite of all the innovations, Sasha Waltz & Guests are always keen to maintain their repertoire: dance classics such as Travelogue I – Twenty to eight are regularly on the bill.
Sasha Waltz & Guests was founded in 1993 by Sasha Waltz and Jochen Sandig in Berlin. Since then, more than 150 artists from 25 countries – architects, visual artists, choreographers, film-makers, musicians, actors and dancers – have taken part as “guests” in more than 30 productions, Dialoge projects and films. The active repertoire includes 18 dance pieces, and 100 performances around the world each year.
The establishment of the sophiensæle in 1996 created an important creative centre for European theatre and dance in Berlin. From 2000 to 2005, Sasha Waltz and Jochen Sandig were part of a four-strong team of artistic directors at the Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz. In 2005 the company became independent again and produced the first choreographic opera by Sasha Waltz: Dido & Aeneas by Henry Purcell.
Sasha Waltz & Guests have now found a new artistic home in Berlin at the Radialsystem V as the in-house ensemble, and have been rehearsing and performing there since it opened in 2006.

26,Schlosspark Theater | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/schlosspark-theater,"

  With well-known actors in entertaining yet challenging productions, the Schlosspark Theater in the south of Berlin provides the finest in sophisticated boulevard theatre. 

Tickets
Dieter Hallervorden is best known for his silly sketches, but under his stewardship the famous old theatre in Steglitz has gained a solid reputation for entertainment of a more highbrow kind. The Schlosspark Theater has no ensemble of its own, but each year it puts on half a dozen of its own productions, as well as a series of guest productions. There won’t be bold and experimental direction, but there will be sophisticated and entertaining theatre with well-known actors.
Ever since 1921, the Schlosspark Theater has been situated in the southern suburb of Zehlendorf in an idyllic villa called the Wrangelschlösschen. After the war, it made theatrical history when Hildegard Knef made her stage debut. Samuel Beckett also produced his most successful play Waiting For Godot at the Schlosspark Theater. With the première of Max Brod’s adaptation of Kafka’s The Castle, the theatre was awarded the German Critics’ Prize in 1953.
In 1950, it became one of Berlin’s state-owned theatres and was the smallest venue of the Schiller Theater, until in the early 1990s it was first closed for refurbishment, and then returned to private ownership.
In the following years as a private theatre, the Schlosspark Theater changed artistic and commercial directors several times. Then, on the initiative of the actor and comedian Dieter Hallervorden, it was extensively rebuilt and refurbished, and ceremonially reopened in autumn 2009. Along with Ilja Richter, Hallervorden himself appeared in Katharina Thalbach’s production of Daniel Colas’s Die Socken Opus 124.
The Schlosspark Theater has now regained its status as one of the premier theatres in the city. One thing that make it special is its varied programme. The theatre’s own productions, always with a star-studded cast, run after the première in blocks of four to six performances over several months. On the stage there are popular and famous actors such as Hannelore Hoger, Peter Sattmann, Jörg Schüttauf and of course Dieter Hallervorden.
In between, there are guests appearances by big names with solo shows, readings and cabaret shows.
At the YAS Junges Schlosspark Theater, schoolchildren, students and apprentices perform together. The youth theatre group rediscovers classics and tackles contemporary society.
In cooperation with the LiteraturInitiative Berlin, it puts on readings for children and young people. In July and August, anyone up to 16 years of age gets in free.
Please note that all performances are in German. 
Before you visit the Schlosspark Theater, why not go on a shopping trip? After all, the theatre is on one of the biggest and most popular shopping streets in Berlin. Two imposing 1970s buildings dominate the street – the Kreisel and the Bierpinsel. The Kreisel is a rather plain tower block, but the Bierpinsel with its striking architecture is one of the most unusual buildings in the whole of Berlin. Unfortunately it has been empty for some time, so you can’t enjoy a beer there, but you can get one, as well as typical Berlin food, at the Hoppegarten, a traditional old Steglitz pub.
Right next to the Schlosspark Theater you can take a trip back to the 1950s. The Adria Filmtheater looks just like it did back then – even if it does show the latest films.

27,Deutsche Oper Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/deutsche-oper-berlin,"

  In the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the city’s largest opera house, you can enjoy world-renowned operas with a great view of the stage from all 2000 seats.
  
Tickets
Behind its linear design and unadorned façade, the Deutsche Oper Berlin presents the world of opera to a broad audience of music lovers. Inside, the architectural elements focus on the essentials, with all seats in the auditorium offering an unimpeded view of the stage. The spacious foyers are ideal for a stroll, a drink or a snack in the interval, and the impressive façade windows provide a view out across the vibrant Bismarckstraße. But the star here, naturally, is opera – with the Deutsche Oper Berlin showcasing stunning productions of the best in grand opera!
Traditionally, the Deutsche Oper Berlin is home to classical nineteenth-century opera, in particular Verdi, Puccini, Wagner and Strauss. But the spectrum of works also regularly includes French composers and Italian bel canto operas, as well as rediscovered works from the early twentieth century. For the 2017|18 seasons, General Manager Dietmar Schwarz and Scottish conductor Donald Runnicles, the General Music Director, are also planning new productions of works by Giacomo Meyerbeer and Benjamin Britten.
Together with the grand opera repertoire, there is now a new emphasis on showcasing contemporary opera composers. Here, the Deutsche Oper Berlin is renowned for its promotion programme dedicated to young talents and enriching the world of opera through its series of commissioned works. Over the years, the Deutsche Oper Berlin has also garnered an enviable reputation for productions by such renowned directors as Götz Friedrich, Hans Neuenfels and Achim Freyer.  
For its programme of new, unusual and experimental works, the Deutsche Oper Berlin has found an appropriately unique venue – its Tischlerei stage in the old carpenter’s workshop. With none of the traditional fixed borders between stage and auditorium, this large and flexible space is ideal for a range of new works and new formats in opera and musical theatre. Through its excitingly different approach, the old Tischlerei opens up the world of music to a wide audience – with a programme including concerts for parents with babies, or music theatre for children from as young as two years old!
On the opera stage, the spotlight is on the individuals and their fates. Away from the auditorium, though, the Deutsche Oper Berlin also explores these performances in other ways – in particular, through a series of temporary exhibitions of photographic works reflecting and complementing the season’s programme. The photographs enter into a dialogue with the events on stage, and can be enjoyed independently or as new insights during intervals over a glass of champagne in the foyer...
Founded in the early 1900s, the Deutsche Oper showcases grand, modern operas for a broad audience. In that democratic spirit, the original auditorium had no opera boxes and all seats offered a good view of the stage. This building, though, was largely destroyed in the Second World War. In the post-war years, a new opera house was constructed on the same site with an auditorium seating nearly 2000. This new venue, designed by architect Fritz Bornemann, remained true to its roots, with all seats offering an unimpaired view of the stage. The new opera house – named the Deutsche Oper Berlin – was inaugurated in 1961 with a performance of Mozart’s Don Giovanni. During the years of a divided Berlin, the Deutsche Oper Berlin was the only opera house in the western part of the city.

28,Staatsoper Unter den Linden | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/staatsoper-unter-den-linden,"

  Explore 250 years of opera history! While Berlin’s Staatsoper Unter den Linden is extensively renovated, take a peek behind the scenes on a special tour.
  

How do you renovate a heritage opera house to meet today’s demanding technical standards? And what can you see behind the construction site fence on Berlin’s Unter den Linden boulevard? In the very heart of Berlin, you can gain a new insight into backstage life at an opera house!
The stunning Staatsoper opera house is major sight on the magnificent Unter den Linden boulevard. At present, this heritage building is being completely renovated – work that also involves installing new stage equipment and refurbishing the auditorium to meet today’s standards.
While the renovation work is ongoing, the ensembles of the Staatsoper and Staatskapelle Berlin are performing in the Schiller Theater, close to Zoo Station. The renovation work is scheduled to be completed in time to allow both ensembles to return to the Staatsoper Unter den Linden stage for the 2017 season.
On Sundays and public holidays, you can join one of the regular guided tours (in German) to view the present state of renovation work in the opera house. On the construction site tours, you can view the elaborate stage equipment and magnificent auditorium, and discover some of the building’s special features, such as pile foundations in the basement, which support the weight of the building and are needed to cope with Berlin’s high water table.
Today’s Staatsoper Unter den Linden, one of the most attractive buildings on Berlin’s historic boulevard, was originally the court opera house commissioned by no less a figure than Frederick the Great. Designed by architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, the opera house was constructed from 1741 to 1743. Rightly renowned for his patronage of the arts and sciences, Frederick had the court opera house integrated into his larger Forum Fridericianum project, creating a new urban centre with a library, cathedral and palace. The neo-classical opera house, which resembles an ancient temple, was Germany’s first free-standing opera house and the largest in Europe at the time.
In a disastrous fire in 1843, the opera house was nearly burnt to the ground. Architect Carl Ferdinand Langhans was then entrusted with the task of rebuilding the opera house on the same site. During the Second World War, the building suffered extensive and severe damage. In the 1950s, the East German government then launched a scheme to rebuild the opera house following Knobelsdorff’s original plans.
Down the centuries, many illustrious composers and conductors have been associated with the opera house, including:
The Staatsoper Unter den Linden’s General Music Director is Daniel Barenboim, elected in 2000 by the Staatskapelle Berlin as their principal conductor for life. The Artistic Director is presently Jürgen Flimm. He is due to be succeeded by Mathias Schulz, at present managing and artistic director of the Mozarteum in Salzburg.
The golden stars across the deep blue night-time sky in Mozart’s Zauberflöte (Magic Flute) are renowned as the opera house’s most famous and beautiful stage setting – and based on a design going back to the early nineteenth-century architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel! The current production of the Zauberflöte in the Staatsoper also includes Schinkel’s legendary starry sky which still shines and glitters in all its glory when the Queen of the Night appears to hit the high notes!

29,Komische Oper Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/komische-oper-berlin,"

  Berlin’s Komische Oper has a long tradition of staging opera, operettas and musicals with a broad appeal – guaranteeing a great night out! 
  
Tickets
From outside, the Komische Oper on Behrenstraße, parallel to the Unter den Linden boulevard, almost resembles a white-cube gallery – but the interior is very different! The attractive neo-baroque auditorium, which dates from 1882, provides a perfect setting for imaginative performances transporting audiences into the magical world of opera.
The site has a long theatrical tradition going back centuries. When the reconstructed opera house was re-opened in 1947 as the Komische Oper, General Director Walter Felsenstein was totally committed to creating productions where the music and the action on stage were equal partners. Today, Artistic Director Barrie Kosky is preserving yet revitalising this historical legacy. Taking an innovative approach, he embraces this tradition of Musiktheater as ranging from baroque opera to high-spirited operettas and the supposedly ‘shallow’ genre of musicals.
Barrie Kosky has also revived elements of the pre-war programme, re-discovering and staging works by Jewish composers banned by the Nazi regime. Thanks to this diversity, the Komische Oper has become a magnet for a widely international audience. While previously only German-language works were shown, the Komische Oper is now in the vanguard of venues where all seats are equipped with an integrated translation display. The displays, with individual controls, are fitted with a masking foil so they do not disturb those sitting nearby. The translations are available in English, French, German and Turkish.
Since 2012, Australian theatre and opera director Barrie Kosky has applied his passion and expertise to honing the Komische Oper’s profile. Not only does he have a talent for staging unjustly forgotten or less well known pieces, but brings well-loved favourites into the modern era. The playful elements he introduced into his 2012 staging of Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte (Magic Flute), including animated graphics and a great love of detail, has resulted in a production of this classic opera which is both a firm fixture in the repertoire and a huge success on worldwide tours.
Together with its enthusiasm for expanding the traditional borders of opera, operetta and musicals, the Komische Oper is also renowned for its high quality standards. Its dedication to perfection was crowned with the influential Opernwelt magazine naming it Opera House of the Year in 2013 – the second time the Komische Oper has won this accolade since 2007, at that time under Artistic Director Andreas Homoki. In addition, the Komische Oper was awarded the much-coveted Opera Company prize at the International Opera Awards in 2015. The General Music Director at the Komische Oper is the Hungarian conductor Henrik Nánási.

The first theatre on the Behrenstraße site was opened in the seventeenth century, primarily staging operettas and Singspiel, a form of German-language music drama. In 1898, reconstructed and renamed the Metropol Theatre, this became a venue legendary for its popular satirical annual revues. After the First World War, the repertoire focused particularly on operettas.
Under the Nazi regime, all German Jewish performers and musicians were banned from working in the theatre. As the bombing raids intensified at the end of the Second World War, the opera house was closed permanently. At this time, the foyer and entrance area were severely damaged. In the mid-1960s, architect Kunz Nierade redesigned the front of the building, creating the look it has today. The main auditorium, which seats 1190, largely escaped the war damage and is today a heritage building.
Dedicated tours for school classes not only explore the opera house on the audience side of the curtain, but also take a look at life back stage. For pupils and teachers, concert rehearsals with the conductor explaining the music being played are an especial highlight and offer a fascinating insight into the work of a conductor and orchestra.

The prima ballerina floats in the air for a seemingly endless moment, as if the law of gravity has been suspended. Then she lands as light as feather, and elegantly performs a pirouette. Consummate grace and beauty – and visitors to all of Berlin’s three opera houses can admire the outstanding skills of the dancers in the Staatsballett company.
In 2014, the Staatsballett Berlin celebrated its tenth anniversary. But its roots and traditions go much further back, since this modern company was founded by merging the previously independent ballet companies at Berlin’s three opera houses.
Today, the Staatsballett is acknowledged as one of the world’s leading ballet companies. It is not just Berlin’s only classically trained ballet ensemble, but also one of the largest companies in Germany.
The Staatsballett’s three home venues are:
From the 2014/2015 season, renowned choreography and ballet director Nacho Duato took over as Artistic Director of the Staatsballett Berlin. Not only does he bring with him a wealth of experience, but he will also be integrating his own much admired choreographies into the work of the company.
As Artistic Director, Nacho Duato is succeeding the Russian star dancer Vladimir Malakhov, as famous for his stage charisma as for his gravity-defying leaps which leave audiences gasping in amazement.
The company’s dancers present the entire range of the ballet repertoire. Naturally, such masterpieces of classical ballet as Giselle and Swan Lake are firm favourites – and with productions of Sleeping Beauty and Nutcracker on offer as well, all of Tchaikovsky’s magnificent ballets can be seen on Berlin’s stages. But the programme also includes neo-classical and contemporary works, such as the triple bill Duato | Kylian | Naharin by Nacho Duato or Ghosts from 2014, inspired by Ibsen’s famous play of the same name.
The Staatsballett Berlin has a broad education and outreach programme to foster and promote young dancers. Here, the Staatsballett Berlin’s education programme works together with the Tanz ist Klasse association to provide insights into the company’s work in projects and workshops. The programme also offers ballet performances especially for and by children.

  Alexanderplatz has always been one of the liveliest places in Berlin, with shops, cinemas, restaurants, and many attractions within walking distance. 
  

Alexanderplatz in Mitte is one of the best-known public squares in Berlin – and it’s certainly the biggest. Named after Tsar Alexander I, who visited the Prussian capital in 1805, most people simply call it Alex. 
Alexanderplatz is Berlin’s eastern centre and is an important transport junction – for the S-Bahn, U-Bahn, regional trains, trams and buses. It also has a great many great tourist attractions within walking distance, making it the ideal starting point for a sightseeing tour of Berlin.
Up to the 1850s, Alexanderplatz was a military parade and exercise ground, as well as a place where local farmers sold their produce. It became a major transport junction when the railway station opened in 1882.
The construction of the central market hall in 1886 and the Tietz department store between 1904 and 1911 made the square the city’s main shopping centre. It gained literary fame around the world with Alfred Döblin’s 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.
Alexanderplatz is not only a major transport junction, but also a historic site. There was street fighting in the square during the March Revolution of 1848, and in November 1989 – just before the fall of the Berlin wall – the peaceful demonstrations against the East German regime culminated here.
Did you know that in the 1920s a huge roundabout and skyscrapers were planned on Alexanderplatz?
The story behind the new development of Alexanderplatz and many other exciting stories about Berlin''s history are presented in our app ABOUT BERLIN.

Largely destroyed in the Second World War, Alexanderplatz did not take its current shape until the 1960s. With the square converted to a pedestrian zone, it is surrounded by busy multiple-lane roads. It was during this time that the big department store then known as Centrum was built, along with the adjacent Alex-Passagen, the Weltzeituhr (world clock), the Brunnen der Völkerfreundschaft (Fountain of International Friendship) and the Fernsehturm – East Berlin’s famous television tower. After the square was completed in 1971, it was often the venue for large events such as the celebrations for the 25th anniversary of the GDR.
Since reunification, Alexanderplatz has been in a constant state of change: a shopping centre, a multiplex cinema, a department store, shops, hotels – more and more facilities are being built, yet there are still gaps. There are plans for several high-rise buildings around the square, but whether and in what form this project takes place has not yet been decided. Only one thing’s for certain: Alexanderplatz is still the biggest public square in any city in Germany.

Alexanderplatz is a pedestrian zone that is busy day and night. There is hardly anywhere to park so we recommend coming by public transport.
In the winter you will find several Christmas markets at Alexanderplatz: at the Rotes Rathaus, at the Alexa shopping centre and around the world clock. For more information on this and everything else you need to know about Berlin in winter, go to winter.visitBerlin.de.

189,Berlin Cathedral | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-cathedral,"
The magnificent dome of the Cathedral Church (Berliner Dom) is one of the main landmarks in Berlin’s cityscape – and marks the spot of the impressive basilica housing the city’s most important Protestant church. With its elaborate decorative and ornamental designs, the church interior is especially worth seeing.
Yet although the church is known as a cathedral, it actually has the status of a parish church – though not just any parish. This was the court church to the Hohenzollern dynasty, the rulers of Prussia and later the German Emperors. Today, as the High Parish and Cathedral Church, the church serves the Protestant community in Berlin and the surrounding areas. The congregation is not based on place of residence, but open through admission to all baptised Protestants in the region.
The history of the church on the island in the River Spree goes back to the fifteenth century, when the chapel of the new royal city palace was elevated to the status of a collegiate church. As a collegiate church, this was a Domkirche (cathedral church). Even though not technically a cathedral, since it is neither the seat of a bishop nor the central church in a diocese, the church continued to be known as the Dom (cathedral) down the centuries.
In the early nineteenth century, Prussia’s leading architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel transformed the court church into a neo-classical building. But fifty years on, tastes had changed. By the time Wilhelm III came to throne as Emperor of Germany in 1888, several designs had been proposed for a new church, though none had been accepted. The Emperor also found the Schinkel church far too modest, and insisted on a new monumental church in keeping with the imperial monarchy’s power and prestige. Architect Julius Carl Raschdorff was commissioned for the new church, but had to present three designs before Wilhelm II was satisfied. Raschdorff’s opulent, grandiose structure was Berlin’s answer to Saint Peter’s in Rome and Saint Paul’s Cathedral in London.
The old building was demolished in 1893, and the foundation stone for the new church laid in 1894. Eleven years later in 1905, the new church was consecrated. The church was severely damaged during the Second World War. After the division of Germany, the Cathedral Church was in East Berlin. The work on restoring the church began there in 1975, although in a simplified form. The full restoration was only completed in 1993, four years after the Berlin Wall fell. In 2008, a new golden cross on the dome replaced the rather simple one from the East German period.

The Cathedral Church is dominated by a monumental dome crowned by a lantern with a golden cross and flanked by four towers. Raschdorff drew his inspiration from the Italian High Renaissance and the more florid baroque style. With its lavish mix of ornamental mosaics, gold features and impressive statues, the octagonal interior is clearly informed by the late nineteenth century’s love of grand gestures and display. The most notable works of art are the marble and onyx altar, designed by Friedrich August Stüler, and the white marble baptismal font by Christian Daniel Rauch. In the Baptismal and Matrimonial Chapel, the monumental painting of the Descent of the Holy Spirit by Carl Begas in the style of Raphael is also well worth seeing.
The main nave with the massive dome soaring above it is certainly one of the church’s signature sights, and not to be missed. In contrast, the simpler Baptismal and Matrimonial Chapel is far more meditative, inviting visitors to stop, rest and reflect. The Hohenzollern Crypt, the most important dynastic sepulchre in Germany, contains nearly 100 sarcophagi and burial monuments from four centuries. Some are plain and simple, while others are extremely ornate as, for example, the sarcophagi carved by Andreas Schlüter for Friedrich I and Queen Sophie Charlotte, which are ranked as masterpieces of baroque sculpture.
The only Hohenzollern ruler not buried here is Kaiser Wilhelm II, who abdicated at the end of the First World War in 1918. His body lies in a mausoleum in the grounds of his house in Holland, where he lived in exile.
The museum showcases drawings, designs and models illustrating the history of the Cathedral Church. In particular, the walk-in models give an impressive sense of the church interior. And to get a marvellous impression of the exterior, you can climb 270 steps to the dome’s outer walkway – and be rewarded by some stunning panoramic views! The richly decorated Imperial Staircase was intended for the use of the German Emperor. The stairwell comes with an American-made elevator included at the wish of Kaiser Wilhelm II, an enthusiastic follower of new technologies. The elevator is available for use by visitors with disabilities.
There is no viewing of the Cathedral Church during religious services and events.

Tickets
An oasis of quiet in the city. Literaturhaus is located in a nineteenth-century townhouse and is one of Berlin''s most important and most beautiful places for literature.
Countless literary events take place each year in the reception room of the listed villa, including readings, symposiums, and writing workshops. The range of event is quite impressive. Literaturhaus Berlin holds readings of poems, poetic lyrics, narrative prose, and novels, as well as essays, diaries, letters, nonfiction, and academic papers.

The villa itself has had quite a history. It was built in 1889 as a fine townhouse and then served as a military hospital during the First World War. It has also been a soup kitchen, a centre for foreign students, a café, a brothel, and a nightclub. But high culture moved in when Literaturhaus Berlin took over the property in 1986.
The lower level of the villa is home to the Kohlhaas & Company book shop offering a select range of current literature and classical works to assuage your hunger for more reading. If it''s your stomach that''s hungry, then the café-restaurant Wintergarten will take care of your needs. In summer, they also serve the tables in the front yard of the villa. An idyllic spot, right around the corner from the hustle and bustle on Kurfürstendamm.
School groups are invited to book guided tours of the temporary exhibitions at the Literaturhaus (advance booking only, please). The current events schedule with its numerous readings can be found on the Literaturhaus website. Students receive reduced admission to all Literaturhaus events.

36,Literaturforum im Brechthaus | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/literaturforum-im-brechthaus,"

  Love Brecht? The Literature Forum at the Brecht House organises many exciting readings and not just works by Brecht. 
  

The literary readings at the Literature Forum are a delight not just for fans of Bertolt Brecht, but for all lovers of literature. Writers present their latest works as the hubbub of the city passes by the house''s large windows.
Readings, exhibitions, talks, film, and theatre performances are held in the Literature Forum, which sees itself as standing in the tradition of German playwright Bertolt Brecht, who lived in this house until his death in 1956. The Literature Forum questions the role of arts and culture in society and politics and tries to initiate a lively debate.  Writers present their latest works and engage in dialogue with other writers, critics, and the audience.  Of course, Brecht''s own work plays a special role in the Forum''s agenda. Regular events show its continuing importance to the artists of today.
The playwright lived in this 1840 home with his wife, actress Helene Weigel from 1953 until his death in 1956. In the rooms on the first floor of the side wing, the Brecht-Weigel memorial is housed, home to the most extensive Brecht archive in the world. This also the headquarters of Brecht-Erben, the company that manages the rights to Brecht''s works. The Literature Forum has its event space on the ground floor, a former shop space with a large display window.
Originally the Literature Forum was founded in 1978 as the Brecht Centre to provide access to the works of Brecht and organise Brecht-related events. The leaders of the Brecht Centre also organised readings and discussions with other writers and artists. The Brecht Centre survived the end of the Communist era due to its international reputation and was able to continue its work. Although Brecht''s works are still an important part of the programme, the Literature Forum now sees itself as a central institution for German literature and is dedicated to the works of contemporary artists.
The graves of Bertolt Brecht and Helene Weigel are in the Dorotheenstadt Cemetery, right next door to the house they shared.

45,Brücke Museum - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/brucke-museum,"
A bungalow in Dahlem houses the largest displayed collection of works by the art group, Die Brücke (The Bridge). About 400 paintings, thousands of drawings, watercolours and sculptures await. Enter the world of avant-garde artists, who stood for a completely new attitude towards life - free, unacademic, personal and passionate. The work and lifestyles of Die Brücke members were revolutionary at the beginning of the 20th century. At first meeting with mixed reactions, the group''s work eventually acquired nationwide and international importance.
In the 1960s, Die Brücke member Karl Schmidt-Rottluff establishes a new exhibition building in Berlin. In September 1967, the Brücke-Museum opens at the edge of the Grunewald forest. The location in the countryside reflects the collective''s strong focus on nature. The gallery features the artists'' extensive collections and gifts from Die Brücke friends. The spirit of the group is both preserved and displayed. Behind the façade of the elegant building are four large, simple rooms. Here, the gallery presents the paintings of Die Brücke artists. They are characterised by clean lines, angular forms and striking contrasts. In the brightly-lit rooms, the colourful images of the Dresden Expressionists become even more impactful. In addition, see rare watercolours and drawings, crafts and sculptures. Throughout the year, the museum holds temporary exhibitions with a focus on a theme or particular Die Brücke member. Works by artists contemporary to Die Brücke are also exhibited: from the beginning die Brücke seeks out like-minded people. Since 1986, the museum additionally houses an archive of prints and documents.
From the Brücke-Museum, it is a 5-minute walk to the Kunsthaus Dahlem, located in the former studio of National Socialist sculptor Arno Breker. Since 2015, It has housed exhibition rooms for German post-war modernist art from East and West. A tour through the sculpture garden is highly recommended. Art fans will also love the Köppe Contemporary gallery, which mainly shows work by young Berlin artists. One of the most comprehensive collections of European everyday culture is housed in the Museum of European Cultures. Gain insight into European rituals, traditions, and religions from the 18th century until today. In the nearby Botanical Museum, follow in the footsteps of Alexander von Humboldt and see the outcome of his passion for collecting while on his travels. The adjacent Botanical Garden is one of the most important of its kind. Here, more than 20,000 plant species thrive. In a former soldiers'' cinema and historical library, you will find the Allied Museum. The exhibition focuses on the role of Western powers in Germany from 1945 to 1994.
Take bus line 115 to stop Clayallee/Pücklerstrasse. From here, it is only about 500 metres to the museum complex. The nearest underground station, Podbielskiallee, is located two kilometres away on underground line U3. For drivers, the museum offers free parking. Student and school classes enjoy free entry. If you want to visit the Kunsthaus Dahlem next to the Brücke-Museum, purchase a combi-ticket. The Berlin Museum Pass provides you with free admission. The museum offers free guided tours every Sunday at 11:30. Please register for group tours. The Brücke-Museum is closed on Tuesdays.

48,Märkisches Museum | Stadtmuseum Berlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/markisches-museum-stadtmuseum-berlin,"
Please note: The Märkisches Museum is revising the permanent Berlin exhibition. Many exhibition rooms are therefore temporarily inaccessible. Until the new exhibition opens on 10 June, admission is therefore free!
The rooms of the Märkisches Museum presents the diverse history of the German capital. Travel back in time and discover the Köpenicker Altar from the 16th century, or a real armoury. At the same time, you can experience the daily life of old Berlin: stroll through historical streets in the themed rooms. Or pay a visit to a barber from the turn of the previous century – the famous court barber Haby. Breathe in the air of history and feel the unique ambience of each Berlin district through film, photos, painting and sculpture. Especially the everyday objects that bring you closer to the lives of past Berliners. Together with four other houses such as the Nikolaikirche, the Ephraim Palais, the Knoblauchhaus and the Düppel Museum Village, the building forms the Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin.
The end of the 19th century calls for a city museum in Berlin, and in 1874 the Märkisches Provinzialmuseum is founded by a group of citizens. The collection outgrows the Baroque Palais Podewils, and the current structure is constructed between 1899 to 1908 under the supervision of Ludwig Hoffmann, the director of urban planning and construction. The museum is hugely popular for many years. The Berlin Wall also divides the museums, and in 1962 the Berlin Museum is built in the western part of the divided city. After reunification, the city renovates the historic museum in Köllnischer Park, and since then, visitors have been able to touch Berlin''s history in the Stadtmuseum.
The museum is home to over 45 million artefacts. The permanent exhibition '"Here is Berlin!'", is an exciting experience where visitors can take a walk through the Imperial Unter den Linden to Brandenburg Gate. Themed rooms also let you discover hidden treasures, and let you learn about Berlin’s Jewish life,. You will also encounter the horse head from Schadow’s group of sculptures, which is the only remaining part of the original chariot on the Brandenburg Gate. Furthermore, young visitors will find that the museum''s comprehensive programme at the laboratory encourages them to get involved with a hands-on experience of history. The Märkisches Museum and the Marinehaus will form a unity in the future and will be the centerpiece of a new museum and creative quarter at Köllnischer Park. The Marinehaus serves then as a center of activities and a municipal laboratory.
Since June 10, 2018, the newly designed permanent exhibition on Berlin''s history has been open to the public in the Märkisches Museum.
To fully utilise your day of sightseeing, there are some other attractions in the vicinity that you can visit after your trip to the museum. Start with Köllnischer Park right behind the museum, where you can relax. This listed landmark has a complex of buildings and an open-air museum with sculptures and fragments of historic buildings. There is also a bear moat where bears used to live up until a few years ago. Next, visit the Ephraim-Palais, a magnificent rococo palace with features like the grand staircase and changing art and culture exhibitions. The Nikolaiviertel is a reconstructed historical area of inner Berlin. It takes its name from the Nikolaikirche – today, a museum for the church, building and city history. Here, you can experience regular organ concerts. Cross the Schlossbrücke to get to the UNESCO protected Museumsinsel. Stroll past the majestic buildings and let yourself be enchanted by this historic place. Unwind on a bench or the grass in the Lustgarten, and revel in the presence of the sculptural witnesses of the past.
Arrival with public transport to the Märkisches Museum is convenient. Take the underground line U2 directly to the Märkisches Museum stop. Children under the age of 18 get free admission into the Märkisches Museum, while all visitors get free entry on the first Wednesday of every month. Other great ways to save is to use a Berlin WelcomeCard or a Museumspass and get discount admission or free entry into several other museums in the city. If you are travelling in a group, you can book a guided tour of the museum in advance, and you can get more details on the visitBerlin site.
By booking in advance, school groups can take part in interesting workshops in the Museumslabor as part of the Märkisches Museum''s offer, Geschichte zum Anfassen.

51,Schwules Museum* (Gay Museum*) | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/schwules-museum-gay-museum,"
Visiting the Schwules Museum (Gay Museum) takes you on a walk through the history of Berlin''s LGBT community. Find out about the life of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, gay icon and transvestite in former East Germany. In the main exhibition space, you can see photos, videos, postcards, letters and items of clothing. There is also a library and archive where you can browse through university publications or lifestyle magazines from the 1990s. Stay later and catch an evening lecture on topics as diverse as experiences of coming out, celebrity culture or sad testimonies about persecution and intolerance.
Berlin needs a museum for gay history! In the 1980s, students Andreas Sternweiler, Wolfgang Theis and Manfred Baumgardt make that possible. In 1984, the first exhibition opens, entitled '"Eldorado - Homosexual Women and Men in Berlin 1850-1950'" within the exhibition space of the Berlin Museum. The project that is frowned upon by some, but the students continue with the aim of increasing acceptance and tolerance. The following year, the '"Association of Friends of a Gay Museum in Berlin'" is formed with a change of venue: a museum with a library and archive is installed in a building belonging to AHA, a gay rights working group. The first exhibition takes place on the 750th anniversary of Berlin''s founding and is a huge public success. As the library and the archive grows, the museum changes location twice more. Today, researchers visiting the Lützowstraße building have access to a huge collection of material from the gay scene. Just head to the archive in the basement, where you can see over 50,000 objects ranging from old postcards to vinyl records and VHS tapes. Since 2008 there has been an exhibition about the history of lesbians, transgender and people of all sexual identities, also known as queer or LGBTI*. The asterisk found on the logo of the Gay Museum symbolises this inclusivity. Take a break in the ground floor cafe where you can browse through more photos and letters, and learn about gay trailblazers and their struggle for respect and acceptance. On the first floor is the library where you can read, research and rummage your way through 16,000 volumes.

52,Werkbundarchiv - Museum der Dinge (Museum of Things),https://www.visitberlin.de/en/werkbundarchiv-museum-der-dinge-museum-things,"
From the purist vase to the kitsch snow globe – the Museum der Dinge deals with objects from everyday life. It is centred around the German Werkbund (DWB), a society that values aesthetic things that are simple and useful. See for yourself how history has unfolded between 1907 and today. The Museum of Things shows you a cross-section of the world of everyday things in wooden display cases.
In 1907, artists and entrepreneurs establish the Deutscher Werkbund. Everyday things have become too alien for them. They want objects that are honest, functional, simple and sustainable. The Werkbund designs objects, but always focuses on the future. That''s why the DWB founds the Werkbundarchiv Berlin in 1971. Here, the group documents and reflects on the history of product culture. It amasses a sizeable collection ranging from aesthetic commodities to souvenirs, high-profile designer pieces to NoName mass productions. There are now over 20,000 ''things'' housed here. As you go through the repository, situated in a factory building, wooden display cases are stacked with characteristic blue Nivea cans. In another, a crowd of toy figures - Smurfs, Garfield, or Donald Duck. The line between garage and commercial value is quickly blurred. A different case is dominated by simple design: curved glass vases and functional watering cans. The museum has arranged the collection deliberately. In the central room, display cabinets are organised thematically. Here you will find the works of the German Werkbund, that both contrast and are congruent with the objects of today. A unique exhibit is the Frankfurt kitchen. Designed in 1926 by Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, this standardised kitchen is a prime example of the response to the urban housing shortage and rising population figures after World War II. Economic, efficient, and cheap housing was accompanied by simple facilities. Its combination of aesthetics and efficiency places it at the core of German Werkbund values: sustainable, rational and functional.
In the Kreuzberg art space Bethanien, encounter themed contemporary art exhibitions. The building is a former Deaconess Hospital with a gripping history. Famous in the 1970s, it was a centre for political activists. In the neuen Gesellschaft für bildende Kunst, art is presented democratically. The members of the association decide their exhibition programme at the annual meeting. Featured artists are mostly young, international, often controversial and always focus on social issues. You will find the nGbK in a former safe factory.
You can reach the museum via underground lines U1/U3 and U8 to Kottbusser Tor. Note that the museum is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Admission is free for those up to 17 years of age. Every Sunday at 14:00 you can participate in a free public guided tour. There are also special workshops and themed tours for school classes and groups. Group discounts are possible. For more information, refer to the museum website.

55,Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery) - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/alte-nationalgalerie-old-national-gallery,"

  Marvel at famous works of art and architecture from 19th century Europe with a visit to the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin.
  
Tickets
Caspar David Friedrich, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir — these are the famous names you will meet in the Alte Nationalgalerie. The museum is part of the Museumsinsel (Museum Island) and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the gallery, you will see paintings and sculptures from the 19th century. The building itself looks like an ancient temple - built in the style of Prussian classicism.
Stop for a while before heading into the Alte Nationalgalerie. Admire the imposing neoclassicist building. The upper section is framed by pillars, entirely in the style of an ancient temple. The idea comes from King Frederick William IV of Prussia. His ideas influence Berlin''s architecture in the 19th century, as it does with the design for the Alte Nationalgalerie - a classicist temple building. Once you enter the museum, you are still surrounded by Prussian classicism. In the entrance and on the first floor, you will find statues and paintings from this period. The floor continues to the detailed works of Adolph Menzel. Continue the tour to the second floor to the Impressionist paintings. Here you will stand in front of famous monuments by Monet, Renoir and Manet. Plan some time to look at famous paintings like Renoir''s '"In Summer'". The rooms are spacious, and every work of art is given enough room to be admired fully. On the third floor, you will find works from the Romantic Goethe period. One of the highlights is the hall, completely dedicated to the works of Caspar David Friedrich. Imagine his '"Monk by the Sea'" and let the wide, grey night sky appear to you.
Not only does the museum display works of art, but the building itself has an interesting history. It begins in 1861 with the death of a banker. In his will, the banker in question, Joachim Heinrich William Wagener, bequeaths his collection of paintings the Prussian state to be enjoyed by all lovers of art. Architect Friedrich August Stüler soon begins work on a worthy home for Wagener''s artistic treasures. Johann Heinrich Strack then takes over and finally completes the construction. In 1876, the museum opens its doors. However, it does not stay open. In World War II, bombs hit the building. The gallery is renovated, but does not immediately return to its former glory. Germany is now divided, and the exhibits are spread over several locations in the GDR and West Berlin. Only after the reunification of Germany in 1990 do they return to their original location. The city rehabilitates the museum once again in the 1990s. A new edition is the highly praised hall for Caspar David Friedrich. In 2001 the Alte Nationalgalerie re-opens its doors and has remained open until today.
As it is one of the five museums on the Museumsinsel, you can start exploring nearby attractions with the Neues Museum where Egyptian exhibits like the bust of Nefertiti is on display among other archaeological treasures. Next, head to the Pergamon Museum and admire the striking Ishtar Gate, which is one of the gates of the city of Babylon. The next place to visit is the Bode Museum, located right behind the Pergamon. This magnificently designed place is home to Byzantine art and sculptures as well as an impressive numismatic collection of over 50,000 coins. Here you can also view the works of Tilman Riemenschneider, sarcophagi from Rome, and late antiquity artworks. Make your final stop of an art-filled day of sightseeing at the Altes Museum (Old Museum). This classical building houses Greek and Roman artefacts including the portraits of Caesar and Cleopatra.
Museumsinsel is located in Berlin Mitte. To get there, take the S-Bahn to Hackescher Markt. There is no parking on the island so you will have to park near Alexander Platz. Stay late at the museum on Thursdays, when it is open until 8pm. You can use the Berlin Welcome Card Museum Island to explore all the museums on Museum Island over three consecutive days. With a Museum Pass Berlin you can visit 50 other museums in Berlin for free. For school classes, there are numerous educational programmes such as guided tours, workshops and others events.

61,Neue Nationalgalerie | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/neue-nationalgalerie,"

  One of the monoliths of Berlin''s culture is the Neue Nationalgalerie. Immerse yourself in the fascinating world of the great artists of the 20th century.
  

The Neue Nationalgalerie at the Kulturforum Berlin is one of the city''s state museums, and the most important art addresses of the capital. The exhibition presents important art of the 20th century, moving from cubism and surrealism to American colour field painting. During a tour of the permanent exhibition, you encounter such celebrated names as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, Otto Dix and Morris Louis. Fittingly, they are housed in an impressive, light-flooded glass building by famous architect, Mies van der Rohe. Since January 2015, the Neue Nationalgalerie has been undergoing comprehensive modernisation by David Chipperfield. Until its re-opening in 2019, twice a year you can see the collection in thematic exhibitions at the Hamburger Bahnhof.
Mies van der Rohe''s last independent work, the Neue Nationalgalerie, opens in 1968 on Reichpietschufer near Potsdamer Platz. The building with the ergonomic hall and floating roof is an architectural icon, and its minimalist design works in harmony with the modern collection. While temporary exhibitions take place in the building''s Glass Pavilion, the permanent exhibition is housed in the basement. To the west, a door leads to a leafy sculpture garden under the open sky. It''s inspired by the sculpture garden of the MoMa in New York and showcases high-calibre sculptures from Richard Sierra and Barnett Newman. During your tour, you''ll experience great milestones of painting and sculpture - from classical modernism to the 1980s. A focal point of the collection is German expressionism: with Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Dix and Max Beckmann all making appearances. Dalí, Miró and Picasso dip into surrealism. Klee and Kandinsky give an insight into the doctrine of the Bauhaus - the world famous art and design movement. On large canvases, abstract and colourful, the American painters Barnett Newman, Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly proclaim a new era.
Located on Potsdamer Straße, around a 10-minute walk south of the Kulturforum, is gallery Jarmuschek + Partners. Here, young international artists exhibit. The focus is on installations and painting - both representational and abstract. Great art also finds a home in the Kulturforum Gemäldegalerie. Marvel at famous paintings from the 13th to 18th centuries by Titian, Holbein, Dürer and Rembrandt among others. The Botticelli collection is one of the most prestigious in the world. A few steps away, the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Decorative Arts) presents precious medieval gold smithery, artfully painted majolica and delicate porcelain. Follow the exciting history of design from the Middle Ages to the present day. One of Berlin''s great cultural centres, the Philharmonie, Chamber Music Hall and the new State Library at Kulturforum Potsdamer Platz resound Europe-wide. Cross the Kulturforum is the Zoologischer Garten, the river Spree and Schloss Bellevue, the residence of the Federal President. Prince Ferdinand of Prussia builds this stately three-winged palace in the 18th century. Take part in a guided tour and enjoy the splendid princely interiors.
The Neue Nationalgalerie is easily reached via the underground U2 line to Potsdamer Platz. S-Bahn lines S1, S2 and S25 also stop here. The visitors entrance to the Neue Nationalgalerie is located at Potsdamer Straße 50. Enjoy the exhibition for free with a Berlin Museum Pass.

The Kunstgewerbemuseum am Kulturforum opens its doors in 1867. Some of its finest exhibits come from the simultaneous World Exhibition in Paris. Inspirational art, crafts and design objects are used as teaching aids. After the destruction of the premises during the Second World War, some of the most valuable attractions move to Köpenick Palace. The majority, however, remain in West Berlin at Charlottenburg Palace. With the completion of the Kulturforum in 1985, these exhibits migrated to their present location in Potsdamer Platz. The city of Berlin commissions 1960s'' architect Rolf Gutbrod to design the new museum building, one of the leading architects of the time. Typical of his style is the visibility of the building''s constructive components. Opening up to visitors behind this raw facade, is a fascinating world of different materials and shapes. The museum presents precious treasures from an array of eras across multiple storeys. Start your tour of the history of design with the treasures of early Christianity. Magnificent altars and crosses shine with gold and shimmer with rubies. The collection continues with delicate crystal and silver work and valuable chests from the Renaissance. Vases in glass and porcelain and reliquaries in gold and gemstones complete the display. Since 2011, you can immerse yourself in the extensive Fashion Gallery.

Discover the creations of Hieronymus Bosch, Rembrandt, Paul Peter Rubens and Lucas Cranach the Elder. Just 80 metres south of the Kunstgewerbemuseum, you find St. Matthew''s Lutheran Church. This historic church harbours a secret: the '"Stufen'" (Steps) sculpture. Embedded in the ground, stairs lead down into a white wall of sheet metal: artist Micha Ullman hereby calls for reconciliation between the European Jews and Christians. At the Musikinstrumenten-Museum, you can admire objects that produce sounds. The State Institute for Music Research has more than 800 exhibits here. The Haus am Lützowplatz is a meeting point and hotspot for the contemporary art scene. In a 240 square metre space and adjacent wing, the Art Association holds changing exhibitions of contemporary art. Lectures, film screenings and symposia on changing topics from art to politics and economy complement an otherwise artistic programme.

69,Musikinstrumenten-Museum - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/musikinstrumenten-museum,"
Enter the world of European musical instruments from the 16th to the 21st century at the Berlin Musikinstrumenten-Museum. The imaginations of the instrument builders have sometimes led to very strange results. Have you ever heard of the walking stick violin or the sausage bassoon? In the Musikinstrumenten-Museum you will find them all. The exhibition has more than 3,000 instruments on display, presented by the State Institute of Music Research for Prussian Cultural Heritage. Not only that: the musicians’ tools are lovingly maintained and still in useable condition, allowing you to still hear the sounds of European music history today.
Since 1984, the imposing house with its modern façade and large canopy has been the seat of the Musikinstrumenten-Museum in Berlin. Philipp Spitta and Joseph Joachim establish the collection in 1888. A large part of the more than 4,000 instruments are lost during the Second World War. Today, the museum once again has the most representative collection in Germany. You go through glass entrance doors of the foyer and immediately enter the large, bright exhibition room. Reminiscent of a concert hall, the room is circular with a well lit gallery. The focus is on the white-gold Mighty Wurlitzer, the largest cinema and theatre organ in Europe, surrounded by countless key instruments. Through the large windows, daylight falls on harpsichords and clavichords from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The four Ruckers harpsichords are especially impressive. The richly painted instruments from the 17th century come from the famous workshop of Antwerp. There are also showcases of string instruments including violins from the workshops of the Italian masters in Cremona. The names Amati, Guarneri and of course Stradivari sound here. A wide spiral staircase leads you up to the extensive gallery where you will find many key, string, wood and brass instruments, before finally approaching the modern age with early electronic instruments. The Mighty Wurlitzer performs live at a screening each Saturday accompanied by thunder, chirping birds and ringing bells, taking you into the world of early cinema and theatre.
The Musikinstrumenten-Museum is located directly at the Berlin Philharmonic and forms part of the Philharmonic and Chamber Music Hall ensemble. The house offers guided tours daily at 1:30 pm, in German, English or other languages upon request. On Tuesdays at 1 pm each week you can experience one of the original lunch concerts. In addition to the 40 to 50-minute programme, you can also enjoy a good meal.
The museum is conveniently reached by public transport via the Philharmonie Süd bus line with the M41. Alternatively, take the S-Bahn lines S1, 2, 5, 25 or the U2 underground to Potsdamer Platz. From here it is about a 5 to 8 minute walk to the museum. The Philharmonic and the Sony Center car parks are just around the corner. The Museumspass gives you free admission. Audio and multimedia guides are available in German and English. Enjoy public guided tours with exciting sound samples on Thursdays at 6 pm, or Saturdays at 11 am.

71,Humboldt-Box | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/humboldt-box,"
In front of a huge construction site in the heart of Berlin is the futuristic Humboldt-Box. The building is located in front of where the former city palace is currently being reconstructed. This extraordinary temporary building offers visitors information about the spectacular reconstruction of the Berliner Stadt Schloss. In addition, you will find information about the planned institution of the Humboldt Forum für Weltkulturen. Its name derives from Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, two of the defining universal scholars of the 19th century. The city palace will become a centre for culture, art and science. The Humboldt-Box also outlines the brutal changes to this place during the post-war period. From the once centre of monarchy to the demolition of the building by the GDR administration. And from the socialist palace of the republic to the recovery of the urban centre of Berlin.
With its neo-classical surroundings, the Humboldt-Box is strikingly unusual: built in 2001, it is 28 metres and five stories high. The building is an angular cube surrounded by metal and glass. It informs visitors about the historical connections and future role of the building. After the opening of the new building, the Humboldt-Box will be dismantled. In the 3,000-square-metre exhibition area, you will see a view of the historical surroundings of this place. The city model '"Berlin around 1900'" is extremely popular. On the first floor, learn through interactive visuals how the palace characterises the cityscape in the Wilhelminian era. On the second and third floors, experience exhibitions by the National Museums and the Humboldt University, offering a taste of the future Humboldt Forum. This includes the collection of the Ethnologisches Museum in Dahlem and parts of the Museum für Asiatische Kunst. The focus is on cultures from different regions outside of Europe. Your tour ends on the Humboldt Terraces. Here you can enjoy the view of the Unter den Linden boulevard. Relax in the café/restaurant with a modern ambience and Baroque theme - a match for the future palace. On the fourth floor, the elegant, urban Sky Lounge is a meeting and events location.
The Alte Nationalgalerie is five minutes'' walk away. Here you can see, among others, 18 paintings by master builder Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow is also represented. In the gallery, you can admire his famous group of princesses. You will also see works by painters such as Adolph Menzel, Caspar David Friedrich and Max Liebermann. Just 200 metres along the Linden is the Deutsche Historische Museum. Explore 2,000 years of German history here with more than 8,000 exhibits on all significant events. Political developments and everyday life are central themes.
Take the bus lines 100, 200 and TXL to the stop Lustgarten. From here you can''t miss the Humboldt-Box – you are right in front of the building. Parking is available at the Dom Aquarée and the underground car park on the Fischerinsel. The Humboldt-Box is open daily and admission is free. Guided tours of the Stadtschloss construction site are available for a fee. Group tours can be enjoyed on Fridays and Sundays with prior reservation.

73,Pfaueninsel and Pfaueninsel Palace | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/pfaueninsel-and-pfaueninsel-palace,"

  Peacock Island is perfect for a romantic day out – a white fairy-tale castle and spreading parkland, complete with peacocks! 
  

This island in the River Havel was settled thousands of years ago. From the Iron Age bronze bangles, bracelets and hair spirals found here, we know that people were living on the island around 2,500 years ago. In the seventeenth century, Friedrich Wilhelm, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, set up a glass works on the island. This was an ideal location for chemist and glass maker Johannes Kunckel to conduct his experiments into making pure and coloured glass. But when his patron died and the foundry burnt down, Kunckel found himself in some considerable difficulty. Ultimately, his search for a new employer took him to the court of Charles XI in Stockholm.
The island lay forgotten for one hundred years, until it was discovered by the pleasure-loving Friedrich Wilhelm II, King of Prussia. Even as a young crown prince, he liked the island as a venue for a clandestine rendezvous with his mistress Wilhelmine Enke, later Countess Wilhelmine von Lichtenau.
Between 1794 and 1797, Friedrich Wilhelm II had a little summer palace built on the island. Designed as a ruin in the popular Romantic style of the day, the palace was supposed to evoke a “derelict rural Roman villa”. The exterior resembles white marble, though that too belongs to the illusion – the walls are actually painted wood. The little white palace, set in a prominent clearing at the end of the island, also created a distinctive landmark – an eye-catching feature for one of the vistas from the New Garden in Potsdam. Even today, visitors and locals alike are charmed by the view of the palace’s two flanking white towers joined by a cast iron bridge set against the backdrop of trees.
Countess Wilhelmine von Lichtenau, Friedrich Wilhelm II’s mistress, designed the interior to her personal taste. Rather than following a particular style, she chose selected pieces of outstanding quality. After her death, the palace was little used by the Prussian rulers. Queen Louise, the wife of Friedrich Wilhelm III, complained about the thin walls, and preferred the comforts of Paretz Palace on a rural estate to the west of Berlin. Although many buildings in Berlin were damaged during the Second World War, the little palace on Peacock Island survived unscathed and so still remains in its original form today.
Peacock Island is now under the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg. Together with Glienicke Palace and the Potsdam palace landscape, the island with its little palace is inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage.
In 1821, the island was landscaped by Peter Joseph Lenné. One of Germany’s leading nineteenth century landscape architects, Lenné also designed many of the parks and gardens in Berlin and the environs. The delightfully landscaped grounds on Peacock Island are home to a number of other architectural features including, for example, the dairy, designed as the Gothic ruins of a monastery, the Memorial Temple for Queen Louise, and the neo-Gothic Kavaliershaus to house members of the court. In the 1960s, the Kavaliershaus, which resembles an English country house, became a popular location for filming scenes in a series of German movies based on the works of Edgar Wallace.
Apart from the eponymous peacocks, still out strutting the lawns and displaying their plumage, the island is home to a wealth of wild life from cormorants to woodpeckers and innumerable frogs. In summer, four water buffalo are kept here to help control the grass growing on the wet meadows.
Peacock Island has also been immortalised in the wonderful novel Pfaueninsel by Thomas Hettche (see a sample English translation). A great way to get in the mood for your visit!
From the city centre, Peacock Island is easiest to reach by S-Bahn to Wannsee, and then by bus and ferry (€4 each way, reduced €3).
The island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since it is also a protected flora and fauna habitat, no dogs or bicycles are allowed on the island. The entire island is a no smoking area.

76,Schönhausen Palace - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/schonhausen-palace,"

  In Pankow you will find Schloss Schönhausen: once the summer residence of the Prussian kings and then the seat of the East German head of state, it now houses exhibitions. 
  

A Prussian summer residence developed over the course of history to a guest house for Gandhi, Gaddafi and others. Schloss Schönhausen in Pankow has been an important scene of politics and history. It also has a fascinating new exhibition every year.
The story begins when a manor house was built on the site in 1664. In the period up to 1740 many conversions took place, secret negotiations were held there and court officials lodged there. This changed when King Friedrich II – known affectionately as “Alter Fritz” – gifted it to his wife Elisabeth Christine. She spent the hot summer months there for 50 years and extended it to a Rococo palace. Its opulent rooms with stucco ceilings and brightly coloured floral carpets can still be admired today. At Schönhausen, Elisabeth Christine was really in exile, because her husband, who didn’t want her around, never paid her a visit at her beautiful summer residence.
During the Nazi era, the palace was used for exhibitions and as a place to store artworks. 780 paintings and sculptures and around 3500 works on paper by proscribed artists were stored there, some of which were shown in the “Degenerate Art” exhibition.
After the partition of Germany, the first – and only – President of the GDR, Wilhelm Pieck, used the palace as his official seat. The presidential garden is a reminder of this time. In the following years the East German State Council moved in. From 1965 to 1990 it was repurposed as a guest house for official visitors of the GDR. Those invited included Indira Gandhi, Fidel Castro, Muammar al-Gaddafi, Kim Il-sung, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev. The building is now open to the public and features a guest room with its 1960s furnishings.
The “Central Round Table” set up at the end of 1989 to discuss the reform of the GDR made use of the convivial atmosphere of the casino building at Schloss Schönhausen. From the fourth round of negotiations in 1989 to 12 March 1990, the reunification of Germany was prepared and a constitution for a joint state drafted, but this never saw the light of day. Technically, the term “Round Table” was a misnomer: the actual table where they met, worked and discussed was rectangular. It was simply named after the democratic negotiations that had taken place in Poland, which were held at a table which actually was round.
Braille panels and audio guides allow barrier-free access for people who are blind or visually impaired to explore the palace. You can touch replica costumes to get a feel of them. There is a video guide to the palace rooms for tourists with hearing impairments. Schloss Schönhausen is an outstanding example of barrier-free sightseeing.
You can’t miss Pankow’s red clinker brick town hall. Many shops have sprung up around Rathausplatz in recent years. Take a walk through the area and admire the architectural styles of different eras.

85,Haus am Waldsee - visitberlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/haus-am-waldsee,"

  The top destination for contemporary art in the south west of the capital: the Haus am Waldsee presents contemporary work by international artists in Berlin. After extensive renovation, the Haus am Waldsee will re-open in January 2019.
  

An English-style country house is not where you would expect to find one of Berlin''s leading contemporary art galleries. The Haus am Waldsee in Zehlendorf is where Berlin''s young, contemporary artists exhibit their work. Discover arts such as sculpture and painting, alongside design, architecture and even performance art - all forms are represented here. Experience the quiet and tranquil atmosphere in the house, which hosts up to five exhibitions annually. This also includes themed exhibitions, featuring the work of multiple artists.
The museum opens in 1946, immediately after the war. Located in the countryside, away from the busy city centre, it develops as an exciting centre for international contemporary arts. Today, the house welcomes creative talent which has pushed Berlin up the ranks of international art. Supported by the district council, the art centre is run by a sponsor association. One of the unusual aspects of the centre''s approach is putting reflection, sensuality and inspiration at the heart of everything. This includes personal contact between artists and visitors. Start your visit by taking the direct path to the entrance of the Haus am Waldsee. The house, built in 1923 for textile manufacturer Hermann Knobloch, still has a cosy, rural feel. Tony Cragg''s bright yellow sculpture entitled '"Outspan'" sits outside and gives an indication of what you can expect to find within. Pass through the attractive doorway, flanked by columns, and enter a house full of surprises. Inside, the intimate atmosphere aids your enjoyment of the art. The rooms are flooded with light, and are similar to living rooms. Maybe this helps the contemporary art come into its own. Take a walk through the villa''s garden, where you''ll find more sculptures and contemporary works of art. Or take a rest at the in-house café and let the impressions of what you have seen sink in.
About two kilometres south of the Haus am Waldsee is Museumdorf Düppel, in the Krummes Fenn nature reserve. Visit to find out how people lived 800 years ago. The botanical gardens at Lichterfelde are seven kilometres north east, and are home to plants from all over the world. The adjoining Botanical Museum explores the history of plants from green algae to the sequoia. Three underground stops away is Domäne Dahlem farm museum, which has been cultivated for over 800 years. Stroll through fields with cows, goats and pigs and visit the 1920s-style farm shop. From here, a 25-minute walk brings you to the Brücke Museum, housing the world''s largest collection of works by the expressionist group. Among the paintings, drawings, watercolours and sculptures on display, you will find works by Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner, Max Pechstein and Emil Nolde.
Take the U3 underground line to Krumme Lanke, and walk 200 metres to the Haus am Waldsee. The 118, 184, 622 and X11 buses also stop at the underground station. Children under the age of 18 get in for free, and the same rule applies to school groups of seven or more. Berlin WelcomeCard holders receive 28% off the standard admission price, and there are also family tickets. Visit on a Wednesday morning for yoga classes among the art.

  Red velvet curtains, an archaic wooden sculpture, and a small counter: this is how you''re welcomed in the lobby of the Fliegendes Theater. 
  

It all began with a street theatre action in 1978. At that time, the Fliegendes Theater did not have its own stage. This would only be opened two years later on Mehringhof in Kreuzberg. The first children''s play Sei doch kein Frosch was staged in 1979. Since its founding in 1978, the Fliegendes Theater has moved three times. It is now in the rear courtyard of a former factory building in Berlin''s Kreuzberg district, close to Hermannplatz.
The theatre holds up to 80 audience members young and old. It is like a little oasis of culture amidst the industrial atmosphere with red velvet curtains, a small counter, chairs and tables, and photos of past productions lining the lobby.
This modern puppet and object theatre has produced 37 pieces for children and adults since its founding. Many of them are suitable for children as young as 2 years of age. In 2014, the troupe did 120 guest performances around Germany and internationally as well as 75 performances on its own stages. They regularly take their shows on the road.
The puppet theatre''s repertoire include three pieces for families and adults: Fantasien zu Paul Klee, a piece with puppets and objects, Anne Frank – verstecktes Leben for adults and children 16 and older, and Hilfe, die Herdmanns kommen, a Christmas tale for adults and children 8 and older.
For younger viewers between the ages of 3 and 10, the theatre has 11 shows on offer: Including Ein Haus erzählt, Post für den Tiger and Ein Krokodil unterm Bett. The latest pieces include Die kleine Wolke, Das Höhlenkind, Der magische Adventskalender, and Was macht der Mond, a story based on the picture book of the same name by Anne Herbauts. For lovers of German children''s storyteller Janosch, the theatre will be staging Josa mit der Zauberfidel, a fairy tale for children ages 4 to 8, starting in October 2017.
You will be enchanted as you and your children immerse yourself in the world of stories and fairy tales. Perhaps at the next performance at Fliegendes Theater.

  Ronia the Robber''s Daughter, the Bremen Town Musicians, and even scientist Albert Einstein are all equally important at ATZE Musiktheater,  Germany''s largest music theatre for children.
  
Tickets
A place full of cheerful music and exciting stories: ATZE Musiktheater, Germany''s largest music theatre for children. Well-known fairy tales and stories rich with fantasy are sung, played, and told here.

After the performance, audiences can discuss the piece with the actors, ask questions, and work on the themes of the play in small groups.
The outstanding productions also have many adult fans. Besides several IKARUS Awards, ATZE Musiktheater won the National Theatre Prize in 2010.

102,F40 - English Theatre Berlin & Theater Thikwa | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/f40-english-theatre-berlin-theater-thikwa,"

  Two in one: the F40 in Kreuzberg is home to both the English Theatre Berlin and the Thikwa integration theatre . 
  

The F40 houses two theatres: the English Theatre Berlin, Berlin’s only theatre that exclusively performs in English, and the Thikwa integration theatre.
Today the repertoire of the English Theatre Berlin entirely reflects its name. Founded in in 1990, it gained a reputation as a multilingual theatre under the name Friends of Italian Opera – after the code name for the Mafia in the cult film Some Like It Hot. Now that the theatre only performs plays in English, the name was changed to the English Theatre Berlin (ETB) in 2006.
The programme includes everything from classics to forgotten gems and from straight theatre to comedy – as long as it is performed in English. There are also numerous productions of its own. The ETB regularly guests at many theatre festivals and in recent years has developed links with international institutions such as the British Council, the US Embassy and the Irish Arts Council. These close partnerships have resulted in many international guest performances.
The plays at the Theater Thikwa are developed collaboratively by disabled and able-bodied actors, and explore the differences between them, as well as what they have in common. As well as acting, the programme includes performance, music, spoken word and dance. The Theater Thikwa is a social experiment which looks at the bigger picture and has thus become an established part of Berlin’s theatre scene. Founded in 1990, the theatre has been promoting artistic collaboration between disabled and able-bodied people ever since.
In 2005 the ensemble moved into its first permanent home, which it shares with the ETB. The name of the theatre comes from Hebrew and means “hope”.  
The large auditorium in the F40 seats 90-140 people and has barrier-free access. The theatre building also has a studio stage with a capacity of 50-70 seats.
The English Theatre Berlin offers various workshops for school classes.

104,Hans Wurst Nachfahren | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/hans-wurst-nachfahren,"

  Popular neighbourhood theatre on Schöneberg''s Winterfeldtplatz offers a tightly packed schedule of performances for children and adults. 
  

Hans Wurst Nachfahren goes back to Hanswurst, the jester that starred in the plays of travelling theatre troupes in the 17th and 18th centuries.
The charming, lovingly furnished puppet theatre Hans Wurst Nachfahren was founded in 1981 by Siegfried Heinzmann, Barbara Kilian, and Manfred Wegner. It produced 59 different shows in its first 30 years. It moved into its current home on Winterfeldtplatz in Schöneberg in September 1993.
This small puppet theatre in Schöneberg is open year-round, offering a large theatre on the ground floor and a smaller stage upstairs. The café in the lobby has a terrace and opens one hour before each performance to offer arriving audiences a place to relax with drinks and snacks. The theatre has become a popular neighbourhood spot for people of all ages.
The theatre''s repertoire includes not only shows for children, also plays for adults offered in German, French, or English with or without live music.
Storybook classics like the Gruffalo and his girlfriend, the story of the little mouse with its imaginary friend who suddenly becomes real, Snow White, Little Mouk, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, The Dwarf''s Nose, and Puss in Boots are just a few of the pieces performed for children.
But adults can also look forward to exciting and artful entertainment. Classics like Faust, The Heart of Stone, Loriot''s Dramatic Works, or The Door with the 7 Locks, an Edgar Wallace mystery, are just three of the six shows that adults can catch here in the evening.
In spring 2015, it was feared that the beloved puppet theatre was going to have to shut down. The building had been sold and the lease was not renewed. Thanks to a successful online petition, Hans Wurst Nachfahren got that decision reversed. '"Dear Audience, we can stay after all. Lease extended to September 2018'" was announced on the theatre''s website. Let''s hope that the show can go on even after 2018.

109,Ballhaus Ost | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/ballhaus-ost,"

  Located in an idyllic rear courtyard, the ivy-covered brick of Ballhaus Ost houses one of the most diverse stages in all of Berlin. This is a centre for experiment.
  
Tickets
Ballhaus Ost is in an ivy-covered brick chapel in a small cemetery park in Berlin''s Prenzlauer Berg districtt. This little hideaway between Pappelallee and Lychener Straße looks more like an idyllic green courtyard than one of the most multifaceted theatres in the city. What served as a billiards hall and dance club in the years after unification has become a very busy theatre and performance stage with more than 100 events each year. Berlin''s independent theatre scene knows no rest and there''s always something to see at Ballhaus Ost.
The old ballroom with herringbone parquet and metre-high windows has hosted plays, dance performances, performance art, and readings since 2006. Pieces from the visual arts, dance, drama, science, and music come together in various combinations all under one roof to give a fascinating insight into different aspects of contemporary theatre. Ballhaus Ost is now the permanent home for Berlin''s independent theatre scene.
Ballhaus Ost was founded in 2006 by directors Uwe Moritz Eichler, Philipp Reuter, and Anne Tismer. Tismer made a name for herself in Berlin with her production of Henrik Ibsen''s Nora at the Schaubühne on Lehniner Platz.
After extensive construction work, the 1907 former church hall of the Free Religious Community in Berlin became a dynamic place for experimental theatre.
The structure''s charm and history were preserved, with the painted walls fading and peeling and floor boards that have endured much abuse over the decades. The house has been managed by Daniel Schrader and Tina Pfurr since 2011.
In addition to voice and dance theatre, performance art, readings, concerts, and lectures are scheduled at Ballhaus Ost. In particular, festivals and interdisciplinary art projects, such as the squatting installation/spectacle/performance by Osteuropa-WG Kommunalka in June 2010. Artists regularly taking the Ballhaus Ost stage include the established puppet theatre Das Helmi and the Lubricat theatre group. Young artists also get the chance to perform in front of curious audiences.

111,Heimathafen Neukölln - visitberlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/heimathafen-neukolln,"

  In a historical atmosphere, and with a very varied programme including everything from readings to plays, you can expect popular theatre at its finest.
  
Tickets
In the 1920s Rixdorf is a notorious entertainment district just outside Berlin. In addition to cabaret, concerts and film screenings, the Rixdorf ballroom will also host operas and even boxing matches. The house gave the most different formats a common roof. And that is still the case today.
Simple, direct and accessible to everyone: The Heimathafen of Neukölln stands for new folk theatre from Berlin, giving the district of Neukölln a voice. Different styles, genres and cultures are linked with each other.
These are the four pillars of the Heimathafen Neukölln.
Theatre: With the motto '"We are popular theatre'", the Heimathafen started its theatre operations in 2009. It wants to take up and tell local stories.
Amusemang: The legendary Rixdorfer Perlen sing and play Neukölln from the soul, and the regular formats like Sing dela Sing, Fujiama Nightclub and the Radioeins Radio Show are often part of the programme.
Tacheles: The Heimathafen develops and supports local, citizen-initiated, political evenings as well as discussion evenings, slams, the annual Open Mike Poetry Festival and readings.
Music: The Heimathafen concerts are now known for a well selected mixture. Besides local songwriters like Wallis Bird, international stars like Benjamin Clementine, Jamie Cullum or The Streets have performed in the venue.
Theatre has been performed at the Ballsaal since ever since the late 19th century, and among the dance halls, variety theatres and dubious betting shops, an entertainment quarter grew up here.
After the first world war, the Ballsaal was converted to a cinema, which closed for the duration of the second world war and was not reopened until 1954 as a concert and dance hall and cinema.
The Ballsaal closed again in 1968 and was not revived until 1990 after reunification. Ever since then it has been a cultural venue and includes the Café Rix. Since 2009 the Heimathafen Neukölln theatre group has played at the Ballsaal with the aim of reviving Neukölln’s old entertainment quarter. Come in and have some fun!
Café Rix is an integral part of the Saalbau Neukölln. As elegantly decorated as the auditorium, with its elegant gilt plaster ceilings and magnificent mirrors, it perfectly matches the it shows. With delicious meals and drinks, it’s a trip back to the good old days.
Active Player NK! is a project where young acting enthusiasts develop new plays about current political topics and everything else that affects young people. Once the play has been developed, the group get ready to perform it, and for each new creation there is a première. The rehearsals begin every September, and are open to anyone from 12 to 24 years of age.
On the third Tuesday of each month, the Heimathafen hosts Neukölln’s biggest poetry slam: nine poets are each given five minutes to perform their own texts. The audience then decide who goes through to the final. From short stories to rap, from tender love poetry to cynical stand-up comedy – anything goes.

113,Dock 11 - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/dock-11,"

  This trendy dance venue in Prenzlauer Berg enjoys great popularity. Dock 11 was literally bursting at the seams, which is why the Eden was created with new studios. More space, more room for creativity and movement, as well as new encounters.
  

Dock 11 & Eden***** are partners on Berlin''s dance scene.
Today''s dance theatre Dock 11 was created piece-by-piece from a factory on Prenzlauer Berg''s Kastanienallee starting in 1994. It proved to be so popular, that space became short and plans were realised for Eden, with five new studios (five houses, five stars), two villas, and a carriage house. The modern buildings were completed in 2009 after being funded by the German Lottery Foundation. The new studios and workshops are now available for new artistic projects. They also offer accommodations in the residential quarters. Eden also houses its own costume workshop, fitted with the best equipment to supply the city''s creative scene. Professional costume designers and lecturers offer design courses and workshops here.
The space allows artistic and social aspects to mix and blend: some 900 students between the ages of two and sixty come here once a week for lessons to be inspired by new rhythms and movements. Eighty dance courses are also offered for beginners, intermediates, and professionals. New choreographies are created, a feeling for movement trained, and innovative productions are presented. The interaction of teachers, artists, and students creates new relationships marked with mutual interest and understanding.
The focus at Dock 11 & Eden is clearly on the field of dance. There are also theatrical performances and a mix of music, art, and film. Its stage programme has long been known for its high quality performances that change on a weekly basis.  Dock 11 is the only ensemble in Berlin''s theatre scene that focuses on dance year-round. The productions are not meant to be ephemeral, but instead timeless with a lasting effect on spectators and visitors alike.
The artistic work and an openness to the outside world are central and important criteria of the dance theatre''s philosophy.
Human beings and our relationship to things, art and our environment play a central role in '"shifting the interest from object to subject, from things to people,'" to quote Tomaso Trini. The artists are supposed to be inspired by the open structure again and again to embark on the search for the innovative.

The Stadtbad Schöneberg public swimming pool reopened in January 2012 after three years of renovation work. This work turned out to be considerably more expensive than planned, but all the more necessary because of it. Since it reopened, the swimming pool has borne the name of the Jewish entertainer and presenter of the TV show Dalli Dalli, Hans Rosenthal. He learnt to swim here for the first time at age 25, after he was forbidden to enter the swimming pool as a child by the Nazis.
The facility has a non-swimmer pool and a pool for small children (including a children''s slide), making it suitable for a family day out, which costs €10 with a family ticket (for two hours). An individual ticket costs €4 (concessions €3) for one hour''s swimming, or €5 (concessions €4) for two hours. Disabled people can also swim with confidence, since there are water wheelchairs and lifts.

A small kiosk ensures a steady supply of ice cream. There''s also a small playground in the adjacent Monbijoupark. Bigger kids can bring their basketball and throw baskets on the freely accessible basketball court.

The wave pool in the Bad am Spreewaldplatz swimming pool gives youngsters an idea of the force of nature before they go on a trip to the coast by the sea or even the ocean.
On the busy Wiener Straße in Kreuzberg, you''ll find numerous cafés, bars, clubs, and restaurants next to each other. But here you can also have a glorious time leaping the waves, whizzing down the slide, or even sweating in one of the two dry saunas. And if you feel like a rest, there are deck chairs and wicker beach chairs as well. One hour''s swimming costs from €3 for children, while a family ticket give you two hours of swimming for just €10.

  With its opening in 1914, the public pool was already considered to be among Europe’s most beautiful pools. 
  

Today, with up to 10,000 daily guests, it is one the largest facilities of its kind. Architect reinhold Kiehl designed the model after an ancient thermal bath, bringing about an ensemble of public bath and library. A dome construction with skylight and a round plunge pool belonged to the Russian/Roman bathing facility. After the reconstruction of 1984, the sauna area of the Heritage Protected building was in 1999 newly expanded. Nevertheless, in its form, the pool hardly differs from its 1914 appearance.
Large and small indoor pools, originally one for men and women, are with their seven-metre high travertine pillars, corridors and mosaics an image of ancient models, and with their layout lean towards Greek temples and basilicas—an aesthetic bathing enjoyment in a marvellous swimming facility, with an herbal and coloured-light sauna.

For more than 100 years, the place for bathing culture in Berlin. Opened in 1907 as a so-called family pool, the lido has over 1,275 metres of sandy beach at its disposal. Covered beach chair rentals, water slide, vast sunbathing areas on the beach and in the park—here no wishes remain unfulfilled. And when it gets really hot in Berlin, then, within a total area of 355,000 square-metres, up to 30,000 guest bathers can be accommodated. Around ten percent of the area is FKK zone. Beach volleyball and soccer offer themselves up for sport activities. A recreation facility with park area and a promenade invite for strolls and rejuvenation. A boat rental, children’s playground as well as various culinary choices round out the manifold offer. So drop everything, and out to the Wannsee!
Did you know that the lido almost burned down one day before the opening?
Our app ABOUT BERLIN presents the story behind the fire and many other exciting stories about Berlin''s history.

The Wannsee beach is Europe''s largest outdoor swimming area on an inland body of water. Once you pass through the entrance to the listed Wannsee beach, you will enjoy a majestic view of a spot that has been a favourite place for a summer outing in western Berlin for decades. And although the Wall is long gone and there are other swimming beaches on lakes, the Wannsee continues to draw families to its shores.
The Wannsee Beach is popular not just for its almost mile-long (1,275 metres), 80 metre wide beach filled with bright sand from Baltic, which ensures that there''s enough space for every visitor. The Wannsee only becomes deep over a very gradual slope which makes it particularly safe for younger swimmers. A playground also offers a change of pace for the young ones, as do the bungee trampoline stations and snack stands. If you like, you can also rent a wicker beach shelter.

You can choose from an Olympic-standard 440 metre speed skating track as well as a figure skating track. So there''s plenty of space to dash across the ice like the champions to disco hits, try out your first pirouettes, or cling unsteadily to the side. You can also borrow ice skates of any size at the rink, and have them sharpened if necessary.
You can get refreshments and light sacks to keep your strength up from the Eisbärchen snack bar, which is right next to the rink. You can enjoy a magnificent view of the ice rinks from the panorama window on the first floor, while enjoying hot chocolate and cakes. A 2-hour ice skating ticket costs €1.60 for children and €3.30 for adults.

  An arena for Berlin’s top sportsmen and women, as well as international superstars. Book your tickets for the Max-Schmeling-Halle directly from us.
  
Tickets
The last of the summer sunshine is nature’s sign that the season is starting for the Berlin Recycling Volleys and the Füchse Berlin at the Max-Schmeling-Halle. The squads have been overhauled and the title is up for grabs again. It has room for 8,500 fans, so depending on who’s at home this week, it’s a volleyball temple or a foxes’ handball den.
Parking spaces near the arena are scarce, especially on match days, which is why we recommend using public transport to get there.
The Max-Schmeling-Halle is not far from Kastanienallee in Prenzlauer Berg and is directly beside the Mauerpark – the former no man’s land between East and West Berlin. Give yourself plenty of time to take a relaxed stroll around the area.
The arena also used to be the home of the Alba Berlin basketball team before they moved to the Mercedes-Benz Arena (formerly the O2-World) in 2008.
If you don’t like sport, then that’s no problem either. The multipurpose arena is regularly used for concerts and other events. International stars such as Madonna, Robbie Williams and Bob Dylan have played to packed houses here. At concerts there is room for up to 12,000 fans, which makes the Max-Schmeling-Halle, along with the Velodrom and the Mercedes-Benz Arena, one of the biggest venues in Berlin.
The arena is named after the German world boxing champion Max Schmeling, and was originally planned purely as a boxing venue. How it became a multi-purpose arena becomes clear when you take a look behind the scenes. Book a tour and find out more about the history and unusual architecture of the Max-Schmeling-Halle. You can get a first visual impression of the arena and its halls with the 360° tour.

The 1,600 m² skating hall in Friedrichshain has made a name for itself among skaters. This is not least thanks to its indoor half pipe, which is the biggest in Germany, and the many international skate events held here. People from the skating scene get together here regularly to live out the meaning of skating: cool music, fantastic sport, and great parties. The hall is located on the site of the former repair workshop of the German Imperial Railway (RAW), now a neighbourhood subculture and youth centre.
If you prefer a vertical rope to a horizontal skateboard, then head to the 20m high Kletterkegel ('"climbing cone'") just a few metres away. Here, you can climb on various structures with difficulty levels ranging from 3+ to 10. If you make it to the top, you''ll get to sign the '"summit book'".

  We don''t want to have you skating on thin ice. We recommend heading to the ice rink at Sportforum Hohenschönhausen instead. 
  
Tickets
Berlin''s top athletes train at Sportforum Hohenschönhausen, site of Germany''s largest Olympic training centre. The 45 hectares and 35 sports facilities make Sportforum Hohenschönhausen the second largest sports facility in the capital. The training centre was built in 1954 and was where top athletes and future Olympic champions trained during the Communist era. The site remains dedicated to all aspects of sport.
The site is home to 20 sporting clubs, ten national training centres, a centre for school and competitive, and the '"House of Athletes'" with about 200 rooms to rent. Daily, more than 3,000 athletes use the Sportforum as their training venue, including Olympic gold medallist Robert Harting (discus) and the handball players on the professional Füchse Berlin team. As such, the Sportforum is the most important centre in Berlin for both peak and junior competitive sports.
Sportforum Hohenschönhausen offers training for almost any sport. In addition to the classics of football and swimming, there are also centres for fencing, boxing, archery, and judo. There are rinks for in-line skating, tennis courts, and shooting ranges.
The ice rink at Sportforum Hohenschönhausen is legendary in its own right. The 400 metre has been hosting international competitions since 1986, but the rink is open to the public, too, between September and April. A perfect spot for your first steps on the ice or to practise your sweeping pirouettes.  
Berliners probably associate Sportforum Hohenschönhausen especially with the '"corrugated steel palace'" where the Eisbären Berlin hockey team practised and played in front of their enthusiastic fans until 2008. The Eisbären Berlin junior team now uses the centre for their matches. Other major users of the Sportforum in addition to the Olympics training centre include former East German football masters BFC Dynamo, SC Berlin, Berliner TSC, and the ALBA BERLIN youth team.

560,Fort Hahneberg | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/fort-hahneberg,"
Hidden away on the green western edge of Spandau is the last Prussian artillery fort, built in the the 1880s: Fort Hahneberg. The hexagonal fortification was sunk into the hill known as Hahneberg so that even from at close distance it is almost undetectable. However, Fort Hahneberg was never used for military manoeuvres: rapid progress in the development of artillery shells overtook the fort’s design and rendered it useless even before it was completed. And so the fort was used for other, very interesting purposes. It was once the central archive for military medicine, gliders were built here before the Second World War and in 2008 scenes from the Quentin Tarantino’s American blockbuster Inglourious Basterds were filmed here.
Today, the old brick walls, vaults and trenches have completely different inhabitants: Fort Hahneberg is a popular roosting site for bats. Many protected species, including the great mouse-eared bat, which is the biggest species of bat in Germany, spend the summer or hibernate here.  
An exhibition shows the beginnings of the '"Arbeits- und Schutzgemeinschaft Fort Hahneberg e.V.'", founded in October 1993, and the commitment to the preservation of the fortress and to events in the fort that still continues. The exhibition can be found in the former telegraph room of the Kehlkaserne.

  The Tempelhof railway yard became a typical deserted industrial area when it was shut down gradually after the Second World War. Yet, in the course of just 50 years, a rich natural oasis has come to thrive in the midst of a diverse city. This jungle forest can now be explored by foot.
  

 Certain buildings and structures dating back to the railway era such as the Brückenmeisterei and the water tower are still preserved. The 50 metres water tower, as a symbol , is visible, from a distance. Constructed in 1927 it magnetizes visitors and photographs. With its permanent illumination during the festival of lights it has been a real illuminating spectacle. The 4000-square-foot former locomotive hall has also survived the test of time. The spacious interior, where trains used to be repaired, is quite popular with experimental artists. Whether avant-garde theater of the Berliner Festspiele, dance and performance events organized by young artists, display or backdrop for ambitious filmmakers, the locomotive hall provides the necessary freedom for being creatively active and trying out new things. The main entrance is at the station Priesterweg (city railway).
Before German reunification, Rathaus Schöneberg was the seat of West Berlin’s mayor. Directly beside it you can wander through yet another park, the Rudolph-Wilde-Park.

581,Viktoriapark - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/viktoriapark,"

  A mountain waterfall, a vineyard and a national memorial – you can find it all in Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg.
  

Kreuzberg is not just the name of the borough in Berlin, but also that of a 66-metre-high hill. On the top of the hill stands a national monument and there is a small, romantic park. Nowhere else in the city can you enjoy the atmosphere of a babbling waterfall.
In the 18th century, Berlin’s highest hill was known as Tempelhofer Berg or sometimes Runder Weinberg (“Round Vineyard”). Not a lot of people know it, but Berlin was once a wine-growing region, and vines really were grown on Tempelhofer Berg right up to the 18th century. The tradition was revived in 1968, and you can acquire a drop of the Kreuz-Neroberger white wine in return for a donation and sample the Berlin tipple for yourself.
In 1818, the foundation stone was laid for the construction of a national memorial in the Neo-Gothic style, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The monument was dedicated in 1821 by King Friedrich Wilhelm III. It symbolised the victorious campaign over Napoleon Bonaparte and the liberation of Europe from French domination. The monument eventually led to the creation of the park 73 years later.
The Riesengebirge – the mountains now known as the Krkonoše on the border between Poland and the Czech Republic – were once the top destination for nobles and wealthy Berliners whenever they had time to spare. The waterfall that can now be admired in Viktoriapark is a replica of a waterfall from those mountains, rendered as accurately as possible using geological studies.
In 1888, Kaiser Friedrich III decided that the monument needed surroundings that befitted it. The park is named in honour of his English wife Victoria. The idea of the waterfall came from Hermann Mächtig, the city’s director of parks and gardens. Made of large rocks, the waterfall is deceptively true to its model in the mountains – the only difference being that the 24-metre-high waterfall is in the middle of the city and powered by a pump.
At the foot of the Kreuzberg, Golgatha is not just for beer drinkers. It has a large beer garden and terrace where you can relax and dance in the evening. Another popular place to go is the Osteria No. 1 on Kreuzbergstraße.
Around the corner at Methfesselstraße 7, a plaque commemorates place were Konrad Zuse designed the Z3, the world’s first programmable computer.
If you carry on along Kreuzbergstraße to the east and cross Mehringdamm, you come to the famous Bergmannstraße and the neighbouring Marheineckeplatz, where you can browse to your heart’s content in all the small shops, take a stroll around and enjoy an excellent coffee and cake at Barcomi’s.

583,Treptow Park | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/treptow-park,"

  Sunbathing on the lawn or a trip on a pedal boat? Treptower Park means summer in Berlin down by the river.
  

The wide, four-kilometre-long riverside path starts at Treptower Hafen, where pleasure boats invite you to take a trip along the Spree. The path carries on past lovingly kept houseboats and then the view opens up to the Stralau peninsula, the Insel der Jugend and the people relaxing in pedal boats on the river.
Treptower Park is the perfect place for a day out. In 84 hectares of greenery you can stroll along the riverside path, across sunny lawns, past the rose garden and along the shady avenues of plane trees. When it was opened in 1888, Treptower Park was a novelty for the time, a public park open to all the city’s inhabitants. Gustav Meyer, a pupil of Lenné, designed the park in the English style.
Walking, jogging, cycling – whatever pace you like to keep up, Treptower Park has the right routes for you. The riverboat jetty is a good place to start your tour of the green idyll. Continuing along the path by the Spree you come to Haus Zenner, a traditional pub with a large terrace. Slightly further on is the Insel der Jugend, a small island that you can reach by crossing an old bridge called the Abteibrücke, where you can hire a pedal boat, a rowing boat or even a barbecue boat. Just before you get to Plänterwald, you can take a break at the Klipper, a restaurant on a sailing ship where you can enjoy some cake or a smoked fish. This is also where the red seaplane takes off in summer, offering an aerial view of Treptower Park and Berlin. If you’re on a bike, carry on along the riverbank past Plänterwald and the former Spreepark amusement park to the ferry. This takes you to the other side of the Spree, where the cycle path carries on towards Müggelsee.

If instead of starting off along the riverside path you cross the street called Alt-Treptow, you first come to a huge grass area for playing and sunbathing. In the middle of the park is the Soviet War Memorial, which was built after the second world and is a cemetery for 5000 Soviet soldiers. Right next to it is the Archenhold Sternwarte, an observatory with the world’s longest refracting telescope, where you can take part in night-time stargazing away from the city’s light pollution.
Not far from the observatory and the war memorial is what used to be the Spreepark amusement park, where you can still see the big Ferris wheel. The former funfair is now being converted for a new cultural use. There are guided tours of the mysterious, closed site at weekends.
For more information, klick here.
Alt-Treptow is changing from an insider tip to a popular residential area – especially for families. Because when you take a walk from the north end to the south, you totally forget that you’re in the middle of a busy city. The route goes from the Spree through Treptower Park to the Landwehrkanal past elegant old buildings, 19th century villas and a newly emerging neighbourhood.

589,Rüdesheimer Platz | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/rudesheimer-platz,"
Rüdesheimer Straße is one of the most beautiful streets in Europe - at least that was the description by the New York Times. Rüdesheimer Platz is also without doubt one of the most charming sites in all of Berlin.
In 1905, Georg Haberland designed the square, drawing inspiration from the English country house style. The houses are adorned with small front gardens, decorative façades and gables.
Rüdesheimer Platz is the centre of the so-called Rheingauviertel. No wonder then that it is decorated with a large Siegfried fountain, a wine queen and a Father Rhein (Rhenus Pater).  
Bookworms can stock up with books in the “Villa Libris” book exchange box. Here anyone can deposit old books so that others can borrow them.
You will also discover a piece of typical, almost extinct Berlin: A historic toilet house dating from 1900 - named Café Achteck.
In summer the wine fountain springs up on the square: Wine makers on the Rheingau serve wines in a small wooden hut. Local residents and friends come with picnic baskets and savour the wine while sitting on the square, which transforms into a large open air terrace.
The Kleines Theater (Little Theatre) performs the biographies of well-known personalities. A few minutes´s walk away is where the cemetery in Stubenrauchstraße can be found, in which Berlin´s most famous daughter, Marlene Dietrich, is laid to rest.

600,Spreebogenpark | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/spreebogenpark,"

  As you walk from the main train station towards the nearby government district, you will cross the Gustav-Heinemann-Bridge to the Spreebogenpark, completed in 2005. 
  

The park extends from the Moltkebrücke to the Paul-Löbe-Haus and the Chancellor''s Office along one of the curves of the River Spree. Its design offers an interesting contrast of wide lawns with open sight lines and narrow paths with plantings that change with the seasons.
From the Moltkebrücke, you have a view of the Uferpromenade along the river, the historic buildings of the Charité hospital and then over to the International Trade Centre. An inclining lawn invites you to climb. From the top, you can see the Hauptbahnhof (Central Station) across the Spree and get a glimpse of Potsdamer Platz between the Paul-Löbe-Haus and the Chancellor''s Office – all once a deserted no-man''s land between the two sides of the Berlin Wall and now a revived centre for business and entertainment.
At the same time, the park acknowledges the history of the site: this was once the Alsenviertel, the historic embassy district. The district was cleared to make way for Hitler''s planned world capital of Germania, with the remnants destroyed in the Second World War. Only the Swiss Embassy remained. Today, the gardens offers wildflower meadows and perennials reminiscent of the gardens of the embassies that once stood here.

601,Haus am Lützowplatz (House on Lützowplatz) - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/haus-am-lutzowplatz-house-lutzowplatz,"
One of Berlin''s main cultural centres is housed in a 19th-century building on Lützowplatz. A venue for contemporary art, the House hosts works by both German and international artists. Many different genres of art are exhibited, from photography and painting to cutting-edge conceptual art. Complementing the programme of events are regular film screenings, performances and talks from international personalities from the worlds of culture, business, art and science. Yet the House on Lützowplatz is not only for established figures from the art scene. On the contrary, it gives a platform to emerging artistic and curatorial talent. Attracting a diverse audience, the centre hosts up to eight different exhibitions annually.
In 1873, architect Wilhelm Neumann starts work on his house with its striking neo-baroque façade on Lützowplatz, one of Berlin''s most attractive squares. After Jewish families are evicted from their properties in 1938, the building is taken over by an association of Berlin artists. In 1943, it is damaged heavily in bombing raids. During the post-war era, it is rebuilt and in 1950, Lützowplatz cultural centre opens. This new Berlin art institution focuses on classic modernist paintings by the likes of Chagall or Kokoschka. Leading social democrats and trade unionists from West Berlin found an arts promotion association in 1961, with the aim of breathing life into the cultural world of Berlin. This new association buys the building known as House on Lützowplatz and begins to develop it from a cultural club to a wider centre for contemporary art and social discussions. In the House on Lützowplatz you will find modern artworks within 19th-century interiors. The entrance to the building gives a good flavour of what the house is about. Leading into the house via what used to be a window is a metal staircase sculpture by Volkmar Haase. Inside, there are two main exhibition rooms, featuring their original baroque interiors. In total, there is 240 square metres of exhibition space available in the front building. The bright rooms of this former mansion allow visitors to experience works in a relaxed and private atmosphere. The smaller rooms in the side wings usually host smaller exhibitions. Another outstanding feature of the house is its courtyard garden which strikes the perfect balance between tranquil back garden and modern art space.
Just 400 metres from the House on Lützowplatz is the Bauhaus Archive, a design museum which is devoted to the 20th-century Bauhaus movement in art, design and architecture. At the Archive you can find out about famous teachers and students, and learn about the influence of the Bauhaus. You can also see the world''s largest collection of objects connected to the famed movement. Located just around the corner on Lützowstraße, the Gay Museum explores LGBT identity, culture and history. The museum hosts regular temporary exhibitions, and has an extensive library covering more than 1,600 square metres.
The House on Lützowplatz can be easily reached by public transport: simply take the U1, U2, U3 or U4 underground lines to Nollendorfplatz. From here, it is a seven minute walk to your destination. Alternatively, take bus lines 100, 106, 187 or M29 straight to Lützowplatz. Admission is free, except for special events.

610,Körnerpark | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/kornerpark,"

  Körnerpark is one of the most beautiful green spaces in Berlin.
  

In 1916, entrepreneur Franz Körner made the city of Berlin an offer it could not refuse. He had a gravel pit located at the junction of Jonasstraße, Schierkerstraße, Wittmannsdorfer Straße and Selkestraße. Körner wanted to bequeath it to the city, on the condition that a park would be created there that bears his name. The concept proposed by Neukölln Horticulture Director Hans Richard Küllenberg merged architectural and horticultural design to create a monumental edifice in a way typical of the turn of the last century. The idyllic garden area has experienced ups and downs in the course of its hundred years. It was once lauded by the media as “Neukölln’s Sanssouci” and “Berlin’s most beautiful gravel pit”, while other reviled it as “Neukölln’s Misery”. After the Second World War, the park fell more and more into a state of disrepair. It was not until 1977 when its reconstruction began as one of the largest construction projects in the district at the time.
Today, long stairs lead with balustrades down to the lawns which are between five and seven metres (16-23 feet) below street level. Water splashes down six levels before a fountain takes it up and spits it back up into the air. Small canals, trimmed hedges, a colourful flower garden, and plane trees make Körnerpark one of the most beautiful green spaces in all of Berlin. Since 1983, the former greenhouse has been home to the municipal Galerie im Körnerpark and a café. The opening exhibition presented drawings by Markus Lüpertz, who was working at the time in the former studio in a side wing on art in public buildings. For more than 30 years, the Galerie im Körnerpark has been a key cultural centre for Neukölln and presents nationally and internationally renowned contemporary artists. The free outdoor summer concert series and the indoor Salonmusik series in spring and autumn bring music to park year-round.

The Children’s Farm at Görlitzer Park in Kreuzberg was developed in the early eighties. Parents and teachers took the initiative and with the help of many young and older volunteers, they launched a place whose aim was to give children direct experience of nature. On the edge of the centrally located and very lively Görlitzer Park, they can look at pigs, donkeys, sheep, rabbits, guinea pigs and ducks and geese and also touch and look after them. While there are specific groups among the regular visitors who do this, new keepers are always welcome, because the farm is based on the principles of equality and integration.
A garden, numerous working groups in the house and associated workshop and regular festivals complete the range of activities. Admission free. If you’ve had enough of hungry beaks, snouts and mouths you can play on the lawns and playgrounds of the Görlitzer Park. And when hunger and thirst strike, there’s the resident Edelweiss cafe restaurant.

  The Lustgarden is perfect for a break after visiting the Museum''s Island or Berlin Cathedral. It invites all those hungering for sun to come and spend some time sunbathing. 
  

In 1573, Elector Johann Georg had a swamp near his castle drained to create room for a fruit and herb garden. The first '"Tartufeln'" (potatoes) were also planted in the Lustgarten. In the 17th century, the garden was transformed by the Great Elector into his own ornate pleasure garden. Under Friedrich Wilhelm I, the grass was cleared away, filled with sand and used as a parade ground. At the end of the 18th Century, Friedrich Wilhelm II replanted the park. After the establishment of a museum built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel Museum (now known as the Altes Museum), the Lustgarten was renovated in regard to its architecture and landscape by Schinkel and Peter Joseph Lenné. In the 20th Century, it underwent a further transformation, serving as a space for political gatherings. The Nazis levelled it and paved it over so it could be used for mass marches and rallies.
Today the Lustgarten’s grass once again invites all those hungering for sun to come and spend some time sunbathing. The biggest attraction at the Lustgarten was and is the granite bowl. It was considered as being a wonder of the Biedermeier era and was one of the main attractions in 19th century royal Berlin. It weighs 70 tonnes and was brought to Berlin in 1828 on a boat travelling on the River Spree. For its inauguration in 1834, a special breakfast was organised. Around 40 people were sitting in the bowl. On account of its size, it has affectionately become known in Berlin slang as the '"Berlin soup bowl.'"
The Lustgarden is perfect for a break after visiting the Museum''s Island or Berlin Cathedral.

  The water sparkles in the great Engelbecken at St. Michael’s Church. A fairy-tale Indian fountain splashes. Take a walk along the former canal. 
  

Despite its name, Luisenstädtischer Kanal is not a waterway anymore. Instead, it''s a place for nostalgic dreams where you can stroll through the wonderful gardens from Mitte to Kreuzberg.
The Engelbecken (Angel’s Pool) is the only visible reminder of the historical Luisenstadt canal. Restored in 1999, the pool, with its numerous fountains, stretches out in front of St. Michael’s Church. Time flies by when you gaze at the glittering water on a peaceful afternoon. The man-made waterway between the river Spree and Urbanhafen took a detour from its straight route to meet the Engelbecken. Today, the drained canal bed is a park and gardens.
In 1825, the idea was first mooted of building a waterway through Luisenstadt, at that time a suburb of Berlin. Fifteen years later, the King of Prussia commissioned the town planner Lenné to design a connection to reduce the traffic on the river Spree. The real reason for the construction project, however, was to occupy the city’s many unemployed. Work began on the 2-kilometre-long canal between the Landwehrkanal and the Spree in 1848. Four turbulent years later, the project was completed and the first ship passed through the new waterway, which led straight to St. Michael’s Church, and turned just before it into the Engelbecken.
Due to the noise, the stink and the lack of shipping traffic, the decision was taken in 1926 to fill in the Luisenstädtischer Kanal, except for the Engelbecken, which survived as a central square. The landscape architect Erwin Barth argued for the canal to be kept, but the city government could not be persuaded, so he then developed ideas on how the park could be designed. One of his plans was to bring a romantic, Indian atmosphere to Berlin, but the church opposed this. The next draft included a park with a swimming pool, a playground and a small Indian garden. Here too, Barth was soon disappointed, because there was not enough money for it. A few of Barth’s ideas were finally implemented after 1926, and rebuilt in the 1990s after the destruction of the Second World War.
The best way to explore the garden is to take a walk. The route runs from the Schillingbrücke on the Spree and then along Engeldamm, Leuschnerdamm, Legiendamm and Erkelenzdamm to the Urbanhafen on the Landwehrkanal.

669,Schillerpark Estate (Wedding) | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/schillerpark-estate-wedding,"

  In Berlin’s first housing project, the architect Bruno Taut successfully put his innovative urban development ideas into practice.
  

1924 was an important year for the development of housing construction in Berlin. Martin Wagner, who was head of town planning in Schöneberg, initiated the introduction of a real estate tax. Building owners, who had become practically debt-free due to the high level of inflation, had to pay a tax from then on. Thus the city of Greater Berlin, which had only been unified a few years before, contributed to the cost of urgently needed housing.
Work on Berlin’s first inner-city housing project began that same year. The property developer, the Berliner Spar- und Bauverein (Berlin cooperative savings and building society), chose a site in the north of the city, where 303 apartments were built here in three construction phases between 1924 and 1930.
The Schillerpark housing estate would not be the only project of this kind. At the same time, other estates were built, such as the Hufeisensiedlung (horseshoe estate) in Britz, the Weiße Stadt (white city) in Reinickendorf, and the Carl Legien and Siemensstadt estates. Together with the pre-war Gartenstadt Falkenberg (Falkenberg garden city), they all now belong to the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates.
The Berliner Spar- und Bauverein enlisted Bruno Taut as the architect. He had already designed the Falkenberg garden city before the First World War. Ten years had passed since then. Taut had exchanged ideas with other influential Modernist architects such as Hans Scharoun and Walter Gropius, as a result of which he thought about how to improve living conditions in large-scale housing projects. Now, in 1924, he had the opportunity to put some of his ideas into practice.
Bruno Taut experimented with floor plan typologies at the Schillerpark housing estate. In the 1920s, the perimeter block developments from the late 19th century – housing wings enclosing an inner courtyard – still predominated. This type of development resulted in a lack of light and air in the courtyards and rear buildings.
In what was a real innovation for the time, the architect of the Schillerpark estate departed from this closed style. His buildings, while also arranged parallel to the street and encircling a courtyard, were housing blocks that were open at several points and thus accessible from the street.
In designing the buildings, Bruno Taut also followed different principles from those of the pre-war period. Instead of traditional gable roofs he used flat mono-pitched roofs for the Schillerpark estate. Ubiquitous now, there were very unusual back then.
The inspiration for the flat roofs and red brick façades came from the Netherlands, where Taut had travelled on a study trip in the early 1920s. This is why the both the room layouts and the exterior façades incorporate elements of the Amsterdam School’s architectural style.
In contrast to the “paintbox estate” of Falkenberg garden city and the Carl Legien estate, the architect did not use wall colours as an important design element for the Schillerpark estate.
The façades were primarily characterised by the spacial formation of projections, windows and recessed balconies. The façade of the row of houses on Bristolstraße was particularly rich in detail, with its reinforced concrete pillars on both sides of the entrance.
Taut used a more restrained design for other façades on the estate. Under general pressure of costs, despite the real estate tax, he followed the architectural trend for increasingly minimalistic means of expression.
With their south and south-west facing position, the apartments offered their tenants plenty of light. Each one of them had a recessed balcony, its own bathroom and from one to four-and-a-half rooms.
Construction projects using funds from the real estate tax were subject to certain conditions. No building was to be higher than three full storeys (not including the attics, as were built at Schillerpark). Also, every apartment had to have at least one room of 20 square metres. Taut observed both these specifications in the Schillerpark housing project.
Because they were open to the streets, the courtyards became semi-public green, outdoor living spaces. This embedding of the surrounding environment in the residential design was an important aspect of Taut’s architecture. 
Residents could spend time in the lush courtyards, relaxing while their children played – a completely new concept at the time. The social role of outdoor living space was also important. Residents could meet up, chat to each other and build up a sense of community.
However, the community spirit at the estate did not just arise from social interactions on the apartments’ doorsteps. Bruno Taut’s concept also included a kindergarten, communal laundry rooms and a grocery store. This concept was implemented from 1930 onwards.
Not least, there was solidarity among tenants on the estate because most of them came from a similar social background. Particularly supporters and members of left-wing parties such as the SPD and the KPD lived at Schillerpark before the Second World War. One part of the estate was reserved for trade union officials, leading some to nickname it the “red bigwigs’ castle”.
When the Nazis came to power in 1933, many of the original residents had to move out. While they were sent to prison or concentration camps, tenants connected to the Nazi system moved into the Schillerpark complex. The new regime’s plan to replace Bruno Taut’s innovative architecture with traditional elements was thwarted by the outbreak of the Second World War.
The Schillerpark housing estate suffered major damage in the Second World War. Not until 1951 did reconstruction work begin, under the direction of Max Taut, Bruno Taut’s brother.Hans Hoffmann, the housing association’s chief architect, expanded the estate between 1954 and 1959 with buildings between Corker Straße and Holländer Straße. The famous architect, also known today as “Glass Hoffmann”, incorporated floor-to-ceiling picture windows in the apartments. The unusually large windows created a connection between the interior and exterior spaces.
In the 1990s and 2000s, the buildings and landscape architecture on the estate were renovated and repaired.
It is easy to reach the Weiße Stadt world heritage housing estate on Aroser Allee by taking the 120 bus. The bus stop is on the corner of Bristolstraße and Barfusstraße. If you take the U6 underground back to city centre, it is worth getting off at Seestraße and visiting the Anti-War Museum at Brüsseler Straße 21, which was founded by Ernst Friedrich in 1923. On the same line, at Leopoldplatz in the middle of Wedding, you can find the Old Nazareth Church, one of four suburban churches based on Karl Friedrich Schinkel’s designs that were built between 1832 and 1835.
The best way to get to the Schillerpark housing estate is by walking from Rehberge on the U6 underground line. We recommend the Berlin Welcome Card for exploring the city by public transport.

  Wasserturmplatz is located around  Berlin’s oldest remaining water tower, which is a landmark of this city district that can be seen for miles.
  

The water tower was built between 1877 and 1878 by engineer and waterworks director Henry Gill to supply water to the growing population and to Berlin’s brewery site. But in 1914, the  tower was shut down as its capacity was not enough to supply the growing city. Up to 1952, the water tower served as a surge tank and pressure gauge.
The facilities on the premises of the  waterworks were used for very diffe­- rent and unfortunately rather unpleasant purposes. From 1922 to 1930,  a soup kitchen for the poor in Berlin was housed in the engine house. The former underground water reservoir was used for some time as a store and for fish processing. In 1931, the waterworks handed the property over to Prenzlauer Berg. In 1933, at the behest of Hermann Göring, the SA misused the engine houses and water reservoirs that had been used as storage rooms to set up one of their first »wild concentration camps«.
Today, the tower is a residential building. Since 1994, the non-profit organisation »Förderband« has been using the water tank for public art events. Vis- it­ors are fascinated by the acoustics of the tank. The echo in the big tank lasts 18 seconds and four to five in the small tank. You should remember to wear warm clothes as it can be quite cold.
Steep steps will take you up to a park on higher ground. The slope of this park that was restored in 2007 has been planted with roses. If you take a picnic basket, you can sit back, relax and enjoy watching the laid-back goings on in the many street cafés and bars around Wasserturmplatz. Closed off to traffic, this green area also has a pretty playground for children.

769,Nordbahnhof Park | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/nordbahnhof-park,"

  The Nordbahnhof Park is an exciting example of modern park design, providing ample space for urban nature to develop while at the same time offering green spaces to relax in and play on. 
  

The unique atmosphere of the park is characterised by a 1.4 hectare (3 acre) meadow area, a birch wood and a beautiful view of the city in silhouette. The park stretches like a spread-out sail over nearly one kilometre from Invalidenstraße to Schwindsuchtbrücke, thus connecting the area around Ackerstraße in the former eastern part of the city with the area around Schwartzkopffstraße in the old West Berlin. In this manner, the wound inflicted on Berlin by the Wall is healed by 5.5 hectares (13 acres) of tangible urban nature that has developed here in the last 20 years. The Nordbahnhof Park is an area steeped in tradition defined by three layers of history. The former border installations of the Berlin Wall are to be found alongside the remains of the railway installations of the old Stettin Railway Station (a hub of activity in pre-war times), and – as the youngest layer – an urban wasteland, which is being reclaimed by a rapidly growing nature.
History and nature in the same place are waiting not only to be discovered but protected as well. The park is protected by fences and is entered via gates – just as in the classic garden designs. Behind these narrow, channel-like entrances lies a kind of “lost world”. And you don’t need to miss out on leisure activities or relaxation either: sunbathing areas in the form of trapezes and a large streetball pitch on the western side of the old hinterland wall offers plenty of space not only for taking it easy but also running riot.

816,Georg Kolbe Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/georg-kolbe-museum,"

  The Georg Kolbe Museum exhibits works of classical modernism and contemporary art. As the only artist''s studio in Berlin from the 1920s to be open to the public, the listed ensemble is a living testimony to this era.
  

Each year, the museum uses its 400 m² of exhibition space to host three to four special shows a year related to current contemporary art or to classical modernism, mostly with a focus on sculpture (including the likes of Auguste Rodin, Hans Arp, and Renée Sintenis).
The museum in Berlin''s Westend district is located in two adjacent buildings that were the home and studio of artist Georg Kolbe (1877-1947). Built between 1928 and 1929 in the style of New Objectivity, it is no coincidence that they are reminiscent of works by such major architects as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. Georg Kolbe had these two cubic brick buildings connected by a park-like garden with an old stand of pine as a home for him and his family. The museum presents its exhibitions in Kolbe''s former sculptor''s studio, which not only features a large skylight, but also the rails that the artist could use to move heavy pieces he was working on. Kolbe''s living room is now home to the museum''s front desk and the museum shop is housed in the former dining room, where the original furniture is also still preserved.
Georg Kolbe was the most successful German sculptor in the first half of the 20th century. His expressive sculptures, some of which can be seen in the museum gardens and in nearby Georg-Kolbe-Hain park, reflect the zeitgeist of Berlin as a centre of art at the turn of the last century. Particularly revealing for an understanding of their context is their close connection to the now iconic architecture of modernity. Kolbe worked with Walter Gropius, Bruno Taut, Henry van de Velde, Hans Poelzig, and many other modern architects. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, for example, placed '"Morgen'" ('"Morning'"), Kolbe''s sculpture of a female figure with her arms raised to the sun, in the water feature at his legendary Barcelona Pavilion.
As one of the leading members of the Berlin Secession and later the Free Secession, Georg Kolbe had been considered one of the most renowned artists in Germany since the early 20th century. He was friends with Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Ernst Barlach, Renée Sintenis, and many other artists of the period. His sculptures and drawings can now be found in many major museums and public places all over Germany.
The museum''s collection, only a part of which is on display at a time, includes works by the artist that were left in his estate as well as his personal art collection (with works by Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Auguste Rodin, Aristide Maillol), as well as the partial estates of Renée Sintenis and Richard Scheibe.
The enchanting museum campus with its numerous sculptures by Kolbe is also a short walk from the Georg-Kolbe-Hain, a park featuring some of teh artist''s larger pieces. Also nearby is the scenic Heerstraße Cemetery, where not only Kolbe, but also German comedian Loriot, Horst Buchholz, and Paul Cassirer are buried. In addition, there are a number of famous listed buildings near the museum: other famous villas in the New Objectivity style of the 1920s, the Corbusier House, the Olympic Stadium, and Hans Poelzig''s Haus der Rundfunk (Radio House) on Masurenalle with the sculpture '"Nacht'" ('"Night'") by Georg Kolbe.
Guided tours are offered to the public every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday at 2 pm.
The Georg Kolbe Museum is just 300 metres from Heerstraße station on S-Bahn line S5. Alternatively, the M49, X49 and 218 buses also serve the station. Drivers can park directly on Sensburger Allee. There is a disabled access.
Museum Pass holders enjoy free admission. Public tours are available at an additional cost. Individual group tours should be booked in advance.
Café K, set up in the artist''s former home and the adjoining idyllic garden, offers a wonderful ambience for breakfast or an afternoon coffee. A piano brunch is served every Saturday from 11:00. Reservations highly recommended. The café is closed on Mondays.
Together with your children, you can also visit interesting workshops as part of your tour of the exhibitions. Advance registration required.
It takes about 30 minutes to reach Dahlem on the S-Bahn. This district in the far west of Berlin is home to Kunsthaus Dahlem, which focuses on post-war political and modernist sculpture from both East and West Germany. Works on display here include Prometheus Chained II and Maja by Gerhard Marcks. Also remarkable are the sculptures by Hans Uhlmann and Jeanne Mammen as well as the extensive sculpture garden with works by Bernhard Heiliger. The museum is housed in the former studio house of Hitler''s '"state sculptor'" Arno Breker and, after 1945, served as a studio space for many artists who lived and worked here. These included Bernhard Heiliger, Emilio Vedova, and Fluxus pioneer Wolf Vostell.
Berlin''s most extensive collection of sculptures, meanwhile, can be viewed in the city centre at the Bode Museum on Museum Island. You are greeted by a monumental equestrian statue of Frederick the Great right in the museum''s entrance hall. Afterwards, you are treated to works by the likes of Donatello, Francesco Lauranas, Ignaz Günther, and Pierre Pugets. In addition to the sculpture collection, the Bode Museum houses the Museum of Byzantine Art and the state coin collection.

  In the south of Neukölln is Schloss Britz, where you can take in an exhibition or simply stroll through the palace grounds. 
  

You’ll not only find cultural diversity in the borough of Neukölln itself, but also at Schloss Britz. Formally a manor houses, it now contains an exhibition on how people lived in the Gründerzeit, Germany’s late 19th century industrial expansion, and is the venue for readings and concerts. Its park is a beautiful place for a stroll and it was listed as a protected building in 1971.
In 1699 the Britzke family sold their estate to the electors of Prussia for a price of 30,000 thalers. The royal chief minister Samuel von Chwalkowski replaced the half-timbered manor house with a two-storey stone building. The interior rooms were redesigned in the years following 1770 by King Friedrich II’s minister Count Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg, who was also responsible for the beginnings of tourism at the house, establishing a library and picture gallery that attracted many visitors to Britz. In 1880, Julius Wrede converted it from the Baroque to the Neo-Renaissance style and added a tower.
After the Second World War, the manor house was used as a children’s home. It was restored in the 1980s and many items of furniture from the Historicist era were brought to the house. An permanent exhibition now features items such as a suite of walnut chairs, a grand piano and a leather wall hanging. There is also a restaurant on the site.
This history of the park began in 1706 when the manor house was built. Designed as both a kitchen garden and a pleasure garden in the Baroque style, Germany’s first robinia tree was planted there in 1719. Inspired by Dutch gardens, it featured a goldfish pond, an orangery, a small wood and orchards. As the ownership of the estate changed hands, the garden gradually developed into a park, with meandering paths, exotic plants, a colonnade of lime trees, a fountain and a garden pavilion. Particularly noteworthy is the bronze copy of the famous statue of a milkmaid which the Russian sculptor Pavel Petrovich Sokolov created for the park of the Catherine Palace near St. Petersburg.
Since 1924, when it was sold to the city of Berlin, the 1.8-hectare park has no longer been under private ownership. In 1990 the park was listed as a heritage site and seven years later it won an award for its outstanding stewardship. It is also home to Berlin’s oldest ginkgo tree.
From life on the manor to modern architecture – right next to Schloss Britz is a UNESCO world heritage site. Named after its horseshoe shape, the Hufeisensiedlung was built from 1925 onwards as a social housing estate, and is clearly visible from the air.
People in southern Neukölln love their Britzer Garten, which isn’t far from the palace: the park covers 90 hectares and has lawns, lakes, cafés and nature trails. Come and have a day out with your family.

873,Glienicke palace | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/glienicke-palace,"

  The neo-classical palace of Schloss Glienicke has a Mediterranean flair – a dream of Italy on the banks of the River Havel in Berlin. 
  

The neo-classical palace of Schloss Glienicke has a Mediterranean flair – a dream of Italy on the banks of the River Havel in Berlin.
The charming palace of Schloss Glienicke is set like an Italian country villa on the banks of the River Havel, evoking a Mediterranean lifestyle. Strolling through the beautiful park and grounds, looking out over the water and the magical landscape of palaces, it seems hardly credible this is not an Italian arcadia, but the outskirts of a very vibrant Berlin!
In 1823, Prince Carl of Prussia, a younger son of the Prussian king, returned home from his travels in Italy. Thrilled by the beauty of the classical world, his greatest wish was to have a Roman-style country house built on the sandy soil of the March of Brandenburg. The perfect site was soon found – the Glienicke estate on the banks of the River Havel. And with the support of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, probably Berlin''s best known nineteenth-century architect, the Prince’s dream of a little piece of Italy between Berlin and Potsdam could become a reality.
Schinkel converted the Glienicke manor house into a neo-classical country house, and also designed the auxiliary buildings in a classicist style. Prince Carl of Prussia was a keen collector of beautiful objects, decorating his rooms with his large collection of antiquities. But when the Prince died in 1883, aged 81, his family were not interested in his dream of classical Italy. The valuable collection was scattered and the palace left to decay. After the Second World War, the old palace, now located in East Germany, was used as a sports hotel and adult education centre. Since 1995, Glienicke Palace has been restored and refurbished under the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg.
Schloss Glienicke and its grounds also belong to the UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed as the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.

The salons and rooms in the palace are decorated in strong colours, in red, dark blue and green, creating an impressive setting for the furniture and exhibits on show. The Red Salon, the main festive reception room stretching along the front façade, is the heart of this summer palace.
The Court Gardeners’ Museum in Glienicke Park is the first European museum dedicated to the art of court gardeners and focuses, in particular, on the work of the Prussian court gardeners. The exhibition presents documents and objects illustrating the spectrum of horticultural work from botanical drawing and surveying to floriculture.
In planning his summer palace, the Prince envisioned a unity of architecture and nature, harmoniously reflected in the buildings and grounds. To achieve this goal, Peter Joseph Lenné, Prussia’s leading landscape gardener, worked closely with Schinkel to design the park and gardens. As a result, the pleasure ground, the English-style area of grounds near the house, seems completely natural, even though it is landscaped.
The influence of neo-classical architecture is also evident throughout the park. A vine-covered pergola decorated with antique marble fragments leads to the summer palace, while one of the main ornamental features is the Lion Fountain, flanked by golden lions set on columns. In the grounds, the Casino, named after the Italian for small house, similarly has pergolas and follows an antique model. Even the little belvedere, a tea house where the Prince could observe the comings and goings on the road to Potsdam, was built in the same style. When a round pavilion nearby was added to allow the Prince to watch life on the river, the tea house and pavilion were nicknamed the Kleine and the Große Neugierde – literally, the “little curiosity” and the “large curiosity”.
Glienicke Bridge, which crosses the river directly behind the palace linking Berlin and Potsdam, can also be seen from here. During the Cold War, half of the bridge belonged to West Berlin and the other half belonged to the GDR. It became famous around the world as the place where spies were exchanged.
The original “Remise” was the carriage house. Now converted into a restaurant, it offers both delicious snacks and a more ambitious menu. Thanks to its romantic location, the Remise Restaurant is also much sought-after for wedding receptions.
The GartenForum Glienicke regularly hosts events at Glienicke Palace on landscaping and the history and conservation of gardens and parks.

From Glienicker Park you can look out across the Havel to Potsdam. Don’t forget to visit Glienicker Brücke, which connects Berlin and Potsdam. During the Cold War, the border between East and West Germany ran right through here, and the bridge was a meeting point for swapping spies. In those days, the Klein-Glienicker Kapelle lay dilapidated in no-man’s land. Now, the chapel is a shining Neo-Gothic jewel, following extensive restoration. Today the palaces and parks of Berlin and Potsdam are reunited. On the Potsdam side, the romantic Schloss Babelsberg stands on a hill. From the park you can enjoy a wonderful view of the gardens and lakes known as “Prussia’s Arcadia”.

  Here the German gymnastic movement headed by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn began. And today the park is still popular with athletes. 
  

On 19 June 1811, the first gymnasium in Prussia was opened by Jahn. A monument located at the northern entrance of the park commemorates him. And today the park is popular with athletes: across from the Columbiadamm pool there is a sport area, which is home to an obstacle course for skateboarders, a roller hockey court and a basketball courts. Hasenheide is also beloved on account of its large open spaces, which are ideal for playing football. The park''s name comes from the use of the land as a rabbit warren, which goes back to the year 1678. The Great Elector came here to hunt. The park was rebuilt for the Olympic Games in 1936 by the National Socialists. During the renovation phase, the old shooting range that had previously been part of the Tempelhof parade ground field was integrated into the park.
Today the Neuköllner Maientage festival is held here in May. The highest point is a 69 metre high pile of rubble called Rixdorfer Höhe, which consists of about 700.000 cubic metres of rubble from the Second World War. The Memorial to the “debris women” by Katherine Szelinski-Singer from 1955, which is located at the entrance to the park at Graefestrasse, commemorates the cleaning-up work done after the war, which was primarily done by women.

1014,Viktoriapark - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/viktoriapark,"

  A mountain waterfall, a vineyard and a national memorial – you can find it all in Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg.
  

Kreuzberg is not just the name of the borough in Berlin, but also that of a 66-metre-high hill. On the top of the hill stands a national monument and there is a small, romantic park. Nowhere else in the city can you enjoy the atmosphere of a babbling waterfall.
In the 18th century, Berlin’s highest hill was known as Tempelhofer Berg or sometimes Runder Weinberg (“Round Vineyard”). Not a lot of people know it, but Berlin was once a wine-growing region, and vines really were grown on Tempelhofer Berg right up to the 18th century. The tradition was revived in 1968, and you can acquire a drop of the Kreuz-Neroberger white wine in return for a donation and sample the Berlin tipple for yourself.
In 1818, the foundation stone was laid for the construction of a national memorial in the Neo-Gothic style, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The monument was dedicated in 1821 by King Friedrich Wilhelm III. It symbolised the victorious campaign over Napoleon Bonaparte and the liberation of Europe from French domination. The monument eventually led to the creation of the park 73 years later.
The Riesengebirge – the mountains now known as the Krkonoše on the border between Poland and the Czech Republic – were once the top destination for nobles and wealthy Berliners whenever they had time to spare. The waterfall that can now be admired in Viktoriapark is a replica of a waterfall from those mountains, rendered as accurately as possible using geological studies.
In 1888, Kaiser Friedrich III decided that the monument needed surroundings that befitted it. The park is named in honour of his English wife Victoria. The idea of the waterfall came from Hermann Mächtig, the city’s director of parks and gardens. Made of large rocks, the waterfall is deceptively true to its model in the mountains – the only difference being that the 24-metre-high waterfall is in the middle of the city and powered by a pump.
At the foot of the Kreuzberg, Golgatha is not just for beer drinkers. It has a large beer garden and terrace where you can relax and dance in the evening. Another popular place to go is the Osteria No. 1 on Kreuzbergstraße.
Around the corner at Methfesselstraße 7, a plaque commemorates place were Konrad Zuse designed the Z3, the world’s first programmable computer.
If you carry on along Kreuzbergstraße to the east and cross Mehringdamm, you come to the famous Bergmannstraße and the neighbouring Marheineckeplatz, where you can browse to your heart’s content in all the small shops, take a stroll around and enjoy an excellent coffee and cake at Barcomi’s.

  A special green space has been created on the site of the former St. Marien-St. Nicolai cemetery 
  

In 2011 a new park was opened in a quiet side street off Prenzlauer Allee in the scene district of Prenzlauer Berg. A special green space has been created on the site of the former St. Marien-St. Nicolai cemetery as the result of a neighbourhood initiative: It is possible to see not only the wild, overgrown character of nature here but also its former use of the park as a cemetery. For example, parts of graves as well as individual intact graves have been left here. And the strange thing is that it doesn’t put you off at all, but actually helps to make for a very special atmosphere in the park. Ideal, in fact, for going for a stroll and recharging your batteries. There are also some gaming offerings for kids to have fun!
When you cross Greifswalder Straße you’re already in the middle of the area known as Bötzowviertel. The roads are lined with old buildings and there are many shops, cafés and restaurants. At the end of Hufelandstraße you come to Volkspark Friedrichshain, full of joggers, sunbathers and people out for a walk. Enjoy the sunshine in the beer garden.

The Bäkepark public playground is located on the Teltow Canal and can therefore be easily combined with a stroll along its banks. Under a canopy of leaves, children play among beautiful carved wooden palm trees and wild animals, such as giraffes and panthers.
Children can romp around like little monkeys and work off some energy on a wide variety of play equipment including swings and climbing castles with slides. Jungle children can then recharge their batteries on the large hammocks in the open play houses. For parents, there are picnic tables and benches for relaxing. In the nearby park, there are also plenty of lawns where the whole family can relax. Bäkepark Jungle playground, Dalandweg 21, Steglitz. Open all year round, free admission

  Amble through the flea market, a drink from the off licence on the lawn and singing along to open air karaoke – your Sunday afternoon in Mauerpark.
  

If the legendary Berlin attitude can ever be found at home, then it’s in the Mauerpark on Sundays. A relaxed amble through the stalls of the flea market, followed by a short climb up the hill and grabbing one of the coveted places on the swings and letting your gaze roam over the city before grabbing the microphone in the amphitheatre and impressing hundreds of fans at the Mauerpark karaoke.
Directly next to the Mauerpark in Prenzlauer Berg there is a flea market, where the stalls are primarily run by private dealers rather than professional sellers. The range of wares on offer is accordingly diverse. You won’t find well-ordered displays of antiques here, instead the neighbourhood comes together to browse through old records and sell household items, clothes, musical instruments and bicycles.
Joe Hatchiban has been bringing his battery-powered karaoke system to the Mauerpark every Sunday since 2009. Providing the weather is good, he’ll be there from 15:00. Then it’s your chance to perform your favourite song in front of a couple of hundred people in the amphitheatre. Joe is happy to give advice, for example if it’s time to play an air guitar solo or rip your t-shirt off during a passionate performance. You’re guaranteed to get a huge round of applause.

In addition to the flea market and karaoke, the Mauerpark also attracts a great many visitors on other occasions. At Easter, families from Prenzlauer Berg hide Easter eggs in the grass and walk through the park while the children look for them. On Walpurgis Night, Berliners and visitors meet to dance until May starts and on the 21st of June every year one of the main stages of the Fête de la Musique can be also found here.
At the time Berlin was divided, the site of the park was the border strip of the Berlin Wall and the area was off limits from 1961 to 1989. After reunification the no-man’s-land become a public park. After reconstruction work overseen by landscape architect Gustav Lange, the Mauerpark was officially opened exactly 5 years after the Wall fell on 9 November 1994.
Families, hipsters, joggers and cyclists are all at home in the Mauerpark. Children are delighted by the Moritzhof young people’s farm where they can learn to handle animals as well as the crafts of the farmyard. Hipsters hang out in the many cafés and designer shops in the areas around Kastanienallee and Gleimstraße. The route of the Berlin Wall runs directly through the park where it not only forms a route for joggers but also a sightseeing route for cyclists.
The Mauerpark is crowded on weekends. Of course, it''s not possible to be really loud. Because the Berliners want to have a rest on the weekend. Therefore the request: Take consideration of the residents and be quieter.

  A cherry blossom festival and tea ceremony, surrounded by a sea of flowers, for example: Gardens of the World at Marzahn Park promise plenty of space for fun and relaxation in natural surroundings. See the gardens of the world with your own eyes. 
  

A Korean tea ceremony, a Japanese cherry blossom festival, and everything else you''ve ever wanted to know about gardening and horticulture around the world. Welcome to the Gardens of the World! Stroll through the Chinese Garden of the Recovered Moon as you make your way to the tropical paradise of Bali, move from Italy to England in a short walk, all in a massive green oasis in the heart of Berlin''s Marzahn district.
The extensive Marzahn Recreational Park, today better known as the '"Gardens of the World'", was opened by the East Berlin city government in 1987 to commemorate the city''s 750th anniversary. Over the years, Japanese, Balinese, Middle Eastern, Korean and Christian-themed gardens have been added, as well as the Italian Renaissance Garden and the Chinese Garden of the Recovered Moon. The last is Germany''s largest Chinese garden and marks the reunification of the city of Berlin, with the moon considered symbolic of the perfect harmony and unity of the world according to Chinese teaching. The plants bloom year-round in the Karl-Foerster Perennial Garden.
The Gardens of the World in East Berlin is one of the most beautiful idylls of the city and an oasis for the soul. If you''re still craving more after all those fascinating plants, streams, and temples, check out the maze garden and the hedge labyrinth.
The Gardens of the World offer not only the complete world of gardening on an area of ​​about 40 hectares. In addition to walks, you can also enjoy gastronomic delights, such as tea ceremonies in authentic Chinese, Japanese, and Korean tea houses. For weddings and events, you can book the reception hall in the Oriental Garden and the Stone Boat in the Chinese Garden.
The Gardens of the World are the stage for many other events each year: the Cherry Blossom Festival each spring, the Chinese Moon Festival with sparkling lanterns in late summer, and Viva la Musica with concerts and fireworks. As part of the International Garden Exhibition (IGA) held here in 2017, a modern open-air stage with up to 5,000 seats was also built here. The scenery could hardly be more beautiful. The employees of the park also offer guided tours through the gardens for plant enthusiasts and those interested in culture.
The IGA was held in the Gardens of the World, neighbouring Kienberg Park, and the nearby Wuhle Valley from April to October 2017. The exhibition was devoted to the future of urban greenscapes. The IGA cableway also allows you to take a look at the Gardens of the World from a bird''s-eye view.
 
The Balinese Garden of the Three Harmonies was expended to include an energy-efficient tropics house for the IGA. It offers visitors and Berliners an interesting destination year-round, but especially in the winter months. The construction of the large tropics house is also a technical achievement because it requires no heating. Water at 45°C flows throughout the structure and keeps the structure a summery 24°C year-round.
For people with visual impairments and mobility constraints, the Gardens of the World offer a free escort service. The staff also lend free wheelchairs and toilets are also accessible.
The Gardens of the World were the first permanent park in the country to receive the Signet Accessibility Award for the marketing of its accessible offerings.
For school classes, the Gardens of the World offer guided tours targeted to different age groups. In 90 minutes, pupils can explore the gardens on different topics with or without questionnaires.

What is now known as the Gutspark at Groß Glienicker See appears in mediaeval sources as a knight’s estate, and was the home of various aristocratic families in the following centuries. It’s a glorious place to take a stroll and immerse yourself in times past. Between ancient trees in the eastern part of the park is the semicircular family tomb of the von Wollanks, with a colonnade of eight tall pillars, an inscription and a coat of arms. Not far away is a stone ruin with a tower and a stone-walled well.
On a large meadow in the western part of the park stands an old section of the Berlin wall, a reminder of the inner-German border that ran right through the middle of Groß Glienicker See. When you walk alongside the lake and discover the remnants of the border fortifications, you are automatically reminded of Germany’s divided past. A long section of the path that used to run alongside the wall is preserved here. Where a few decades ago East German border guards patrolled the banks of the lake, many waterfowl now nest.

  It’s the fastest six days in the city – watch the unique track cycling event at Berlin’s Velodrom. 
  
Tickets
Pumping thighs, nail-biting sprints and high-speed chases are what make the world-famous Six-Day Race one of the highlights of Berlin’s sporting calendar. The Velodrom is where the exciting races are held, and the 250-metre track is regarded as one of the fastest in the world. The Six-Day Race is the perfect mixture of top-class cycling, musical events and shows, and has a tradition going back more than 100 years.
As well as the traditional highlight in January, there’s plenty for fans of other sports to enjoy at the Velodrom, including table tennis, basketball tournaments, motocross and figure skating.
The state-of-the-art circular arena in Prenzlauer Berg is also a venue for shows and concerts. Renowned musicians such as Robbie Williams, The Cure and Rammstein have played here in front of up to 12,000 fans.
In GDR times, what is now the site of the Velodrom was occupied by the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle, a multi-purpose hall for sports events, party conferences and concerts. After the old hall was demolished, the Velodrom was completed in 1997. It was originally conceived as part of Berlin’s bid to host the Olympics.
The Velodrom is located beside the swimming and diving centre at the Europasportpark (SSE). Both venues are almost completely sunk into a plateau, so that from outside you can only see the spectacular, wood-panelled roofs, with apple trees growing on them. The inconspicuous exterior belies the actual size of the hall, and in particular the roof structure, which is unique in Europe.
It’s not only the cyclists at the Velodrom who are fast – you can get there quickly too. The arena is directly at Landsberger Allee station on Berlin’s S-Bahn circle line. The Velodrom is also easily reached by tram, only eleven minutes’ ride from Alexanderplatz.

Around 17,000 fans stream towards the Mercedes-Benz Arena – from Ostbahnhof and Warschauer Straße stations, and from the banks of the River Spree. And what do they want to see? A sensational three point shot in the very last second of a basketball game … the puck flying at lightning speed in an ice hockey match… or an emotional encore by their favourite superstar.
The Mercedes-Benz Arena Berlin (former o2 World) invites you to a world of top events and concerts. The glittering array of national and international stars who have performed here range from to Andrea Berg, Xavier Naidoo or David Garrett to A-HA, Adele, Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Rihanna and Justin Bieber.

It also plays in the top league when it comes to sports events, attracting audiences of thousands to the We love MMA martial arts series or to watch the wealth of top athletes competing at the ISTAF Indoor track and field meeting.
The Mercedes-Benz Arena is the home stadium for two of Germany’s top national clubs – basketball’s ALBA Berlin and the Eisbären Berlin ice hockey team. But the stadium is not only a venue for premier league matches, it also hosts international games with elite clubs. With nearly 17,000 cheering fans, the atmosphere in the stand is electric – just as it is in the 59 premium meeting and event suites! And no matter where you sit, you can find plenty of snack bars with a wide range of delicious dishes and drinks before, during and after the games – and all without long delays.
The stadium, constructed on a former rail goods yard, is located in the heart of Berlin directly next to Mühlenstraße, a main arterial road. Thanks to an opening in the famous East Side Gallery – the longest surviving stretch of the Berlin Wall – the Mercedes-Benz Arena also has its own landing place on the River Spree, and can even be reached by boat! The stadium’s parking deck normally offers space for 2,000 cars. The Mercedes-Benz Arena is also easy to reach by public transport, and has convenient subway, S-Bahn train, tram and bus links to the Ostbahnhof or Warschauer Straße stations. If you are planning to visit Berlin on a short break and take in a concert or sports event, you can find many hotels ideally located close to the stadium.
To find out more about the Mercedes-Benz Arena at first hand, why not take one of the Arena tours? The tours, which are designed for groups, allow you to visit areas normally off-limits to the public, including the locker rooms and the artists’ dressing rooms. On the tours you’ll also discover what happens to the ice when the Eisbären Berlin ice hockey team are not playing – and the quirks and fads of the superstars! And there are also guided tours especially for children.

For local football fans, Berlin’s Olympiastadion means just one thing – the home of the city’s leading Bundesliga club Hertha BSC, fondly dubbed the “Old Lady”. And when those fans get into position on the Ostkurve fan block terrace, they are ready for a roller-coaster of emotions – ninety minutes that can take them from the depths of despair to wild cheering and the joy of another match won.
There is a very special atmosphere when 74,475 enthusiastic fans gather in the fully sold out stadium – but the legendary Ostkurve terrace is always reserved for the blue and white colours of the Hertha fans as they fire on their club!
Berlin’s Olympiastadion is more than just the home venue for the Bundesliga football club Hertha BSC:
In summer, Berlin’s Olympiastadion is transformed into an open-air stage for the some of the world’s top events. The many legendary bands and musicians playing here over the past years have included such names as the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Robbie Williams, Depeche Mode and Coldplay.
From 1934 to 1936, during the Nazi era, the old stadium on this site was demolished and a new stadium and sports complex built as the venue for the 1936 Olympic Games. Inspired by the clear geometric forms of sports’ arenas in the classical world, architect Werner March created a stadium capable of holding an audience of 100,000 people.
Today’s Maifeld is just one part of the Reichssportfeld (Imperial Sports Arena) planned by the Nazi regime as a site for propaganda events. The sports and events complex constructed for the Olympic Games also included the Waldbühne venue, designed like an ancient amphitheatre. In 1936, the Waldbühne was the site of the Olympic gymnastics competitions. Today, it has become a much-loved open-air concert venue, surrounded by green spaces.
Anyone visiting the Olympic Stadium complex is sure to visit the Glockenturm – the bell tower –, especially renowned for its amazing views. The lift whisks you to the top of the tower for a panoramic vista out across the nearby Maifeld and stadium to the city or over the Waldbühne to the woodlands beyond.
The eleventh Olympic Games took place from 1 to 16 August 1936. After 1936, another 20 major events were held at the Reichssportfeld, including the 1937 German football championship, the state reception for Mussolini and various sports festivals. At the beginning of the Second World War, the Reichssportfeld, which was partially set below ground level, was converted to a bunker, a production site for detonators, a storage area for munitions, food and wine, and a back-up radio broadcasting site.
A history trail on the Olympic site has 45 panels in English and German offering a fascinating insight into the complex’s origins and development down the years, as well as information on the historical art works from the early years of the Nazi regime.
On event-free days, you can explore the impressive stadium itself, either with an audio guide or as part of a guided tour. On live tours, you can also visit sectors normally off-limits to the public, including the locker rooms, underground warm-up halls, and the VIP areas.

At the turn of the millennium, extensive modernisation work began while the sporting events continued. The lower ring was renovated and 13 luxury boxes were added to the upper ring. Today, the total capacity is 74,475 seats. On 1 August 2004, there was an official reopening ceremony for the Olympiastadion. Without doubt, one of the highlights in the history of the new Olympiastadion Berlin was its hosting of the 2006 World Cup Final. The German Cup Final has been held here since 1985, and it is the home stadium of Hertha BSC in the Bundesliga.
Generous parking is available on non-event days. During major concerts and sporting events, parking is limited. The stadium can also be reached quickly and conveniently by public transport on the U2 line, the S5 S-Bahn line or a number of bus lines.
The Olympiastadion is not just an attraction for football fans. Many people are familiar with the five-star stadium from television as venue for sports events and concerts. With the guided tour, you can take a look behind the scenes at the stadium and its facilities.
With or without a guide – everyone can explore the stadium in their own way. There are various panels with information about the Olympiapark site. For those who want to take a peek inside the players’ dressing rooms and the VIP area, there’s a 60-minute guided tour. Your guide is certain to have some inside information which will surprise even football experts. There is a special tour for Hertha fans to find out all about their club.
Tickets are available here at visitBerlin. There is an extra discount if you have a Berlin Welcome Card.
The recommended entrances are the East and South gates. There are wheelchair spaces in blocks C/D, G/H, J/K, N, Q/R and S/T, as well as accessible toilets.

  Which sulky will be the first to cross the finish line? A day at this racetrack in Mariendorf offers exciting entertainment for fans of equestrian sports and those experiencing it for the first time. 
  
Tickets
Trabrennbahn Marienfdorf remains a popular destination for equestrian enthusiasts and anyone else who wants to spend an entertaining day at the track.
Trabrennbahn Mariendorf is one of the most successful harness racing tracks in Germany and hosts more than 650 races a year. And it is also one of the most beautiful sites with chestnut trees surrounding the 32 stables on the 24 hectare site. A particular treat for the eyes is the Art Nouveau grandstand that fortunately survived the war.
Also worth a visit in their own right are the 32 stables, which blend the look of historic half-timbered buildings with the modern architectural style of the wooden stalls. More than 800 horses can be accommodated here. The site also includes several small spots offering a bite to eat such as Traberpause and Champions Teehaus.
The Mariendorf harness racing track celebrated its opening more than a hundred years ago. At the time, it was the most modern track in Germany. It then experienced a rebirth in the years after the war. The German harness-racing derby has been held in Mariendorf since 1952. The battle for the Blue Ribbon is considered the greatest harness-racing event in Germany. It concludes eight days of racing known as Derby Week.
The grandstand at Mariendorf was opened in 1972. The five-storey building can accommodate 5,000 guests and, with its glass front, is one of the most modern grandstands in Germany.
The most important harness racing event in Germany and one of the most important in the world is Derby Week, which has been held at Trabrennbahn Mariendrof for more than a century. The event lasts eight days.
In the south of Berlin, things are much more tranquil in the village of Mariendorf, which was founded in 1230. Its biggest attraction is without doubt the racecourse, but there is also the memorial to the Marienfelde transit camp, where more than 1.3 million people who fled from the GDR were fed and sheltered.

  At the Quatsch Comedy Club, well-known veterans meet undiscovered talent. Be the jury and crown the up-and-coming comedians.
  
Tickets
Ironically, the Quatsch Comedy Club isn’t even originally from Berlin, but ever since Thomas Hermann brought the comedy format to the capital, it has been as much a part of Berlin as currywurst is. The fact that the comedians appear in the basement of the prestigious Friedrichstadt-Palast tells you how well the hosts choose their stage talent.
One of the fixtures of the Quatsch Comedy Club is THE LIVE SHOW, a series with a new show every week featuring a roster of four comedians, who show their stand-up skills from Wednesday to Saturday. The show is compèred by another comedian.
The programme always includes guest appearances from well-known faces. Nearly all the veterans in the comedy business have regularly appeared here. They include Dave Davis, Rüdiger Hoffmann, Bernhard Hoëcker and Olaf Schubert to name just a few. Even international comedians such as John Doyle have long considered the Quatsch Comedy Club a second home.
Tickets are available online or directly at the box office. There are always a few tickets on the door for last-minute visitors. Only a limited number of seats can be reserved, so get there in time to get a good one. Groups of ten or more can make a reservation including catering.
On the first Friday of each month, ten new talents compete for the Quatsch Comedy Club’s prize for newcomers.
The audience is the jury, and you decide who goes through to the next round and ultimately wins the prize. Starting out is never easy, but Cindy from Marzahn, David Werker, Murat Topal and Lisa Feller have all come through the ranks at the Quatsch talent show and started their careers from there. Fingers crossed for everyone who takes part!

1099,Admiralspalast | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/admiralspalast,"

  The Admiralspalast has been home to top-flight entertainment for over 100 years – and offers a sparkling programme of theatre and fun, musicals and club nights!
  
Tickets
In 1911, the Admiralspalast on Berlin’s legendary Friedrichstraße first opened its doors as a ‘metropolitan’ centre for top entertainment. This vibrant venue quickly gained an enviable reputation, and its opulent revue shows in the 1920s came to symbolise the spirit of the Roaring Twenties. Today, the magnificent main auditorium, which seats 1700, and the Studio stage are home to a premium programme ranging from theatre to concerts, and musicals to comedy. The front building also houses the cabaret theatre Die Distel, renowned for its biting and witty political satire.
The Admiralspalast’s Grand Hall, its main auditorium, has hosted a string of outstanding musical successes – a tradition the stunning Shadowland show is sure to follow. Over the last years, one landmark was the Dreigroschenoper, Bertolt Brecht’s famous version of the Beggar’s Opera, staged by Klaus Maria Brandauer and with Campino, singer of the punk band Toten Hosen, in a lead role as Mackie Messer. True to its motto of providing the best in a range of entertainment, the main theatre also hosts such popular children’s shows as Bibi Blocksberg about the adventures of a young and mischievous witch.
The Admiralspalast is also an acclaimed comedy venue – and now hosting, for example, the laugh-out-loud show Caveman. This hysterically funny play, directed by actor and director Esther Schweins, is the German version of Broadway’s smash hit Defending the Caveman, and casts a hilarious light on the way men and women relate.
The main stage also presents a great series of concerts and comedy shows. Regular guests presenting their latest shows to thrilled audiences include Max Raabe and his Palast Orchester, renowned for their take on 1920s and 30s music, and eccentric German musician Helge Schneider.
The Admiralspalast programme is also increasingly focusing on music – from soul legend Solomon Burke to the funk vibes of Jan Delay or the fresh talents on the local scene. At some events, the seating in the main theatre is packed away so visitors can dance and party until the early hours.
As one of Berlin’s oldest theatres, the Admiralspalast’s long tradition of variety entertainment is intimately linked to the city’s political and social changes down the years. When it originally opened in 1911, the Admiralspalast housed an ice rink, luxury baths, skittle alleys and an impressive cinema. Through to the late 1930s, it was also renowned for its extravagant light entertainment and revue shows.After the Second World War, the main auditorium was used for the political party conference where East Germany’s SED – the Socialist Unity Party – was founded under Otto Grotewohl (SPD) and Wilhelm Pieck (KPD). Renamed as the Metropol-Theater in the Admiralspalast during the years of East Germany, the stage here presented classical operettas as well as Broadway musicals.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Admiralspalast was extensively refurbished and reopened in its present form in 2006.

1100,Cabaret Theatre - Die Wühlmäuse | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/cabaret-theatre-die-wuhlmause,"

  Laughter is the best medicine, so book a consultation with Dieter Hallervorden and his colleagues at Wühlmäuse cabaret theatre. 
  
Tickets
Hyperventilation, aching sides, tears of laughter, cramped jaw – be careful you don’t do yourself a mischief at Berlin’s Wühlmäuse cabaret theatre. When Dieter Hallervorden and his colleagues get going, they’ll have you in stitches.
At the Wühlmäuse you can see the stars of comedy live on stage: Dieter Hallervorden’s cabaret has has been a byword for great fun and sharp satire since 1960. Today, the Wühlmäuse theatre is one of Berlin’s premier venues for comedians and performers from Germany and abroad. Dieter Nuhr, Mathias Richling, Ingo Appelt and Heinz Rudolf Kunze are just some of the names who regularly appear here.
As well as comedy and cabaret, the schedule has other highlights such as concerts by Karat or Purple Schulz, and readings by Axel Hacke, Jürgen von der Lippe or Harald Martenstein. Every two months you can look forward to Sieben auf einen Streich, where six comedians and a compère will have you rolling in the aisles.
In 1960, Dieter Hallervorden and other actors founded a group called the Wühlmäuse (which means “voles”). At first the ensemble played at the former Scala variety theatre in Schöneberg, before moving to Nürnberger Straße for the next 40 years. Their current home is at the “Theo”, which is the nickname for Theodor-Heuss-Platz in Berlin’s West End. The theatre has 516 plush red velvet seats, from its former use as a British forces cinema.
The theatre originally made its name with its own ensemble in the 1960s, performing political and satirical sketches and gags. This later developed into an entire topical cabaret show with a full plot – which was something new to the city. The shows always take a basic topic and look at it from various roles and points of view. The ensemble gradually became a platform for guest appearances from both established and up-and-coming comedians and cabaret artists.
Cabaret and comedy go together perfectly. The Wühlmäuse think so too, and since 2001 have put on a cabaret festival which is broadcast each year on local television and hosted by Dieter Nuhr. This means you can get a taste of the Wühlmäuse at home before you see the real thing live on stage.

1105,Deutsches Theater Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/deutsches-theater-berlin,"

  The acclaimed Deutsches Theater Berlin ensemble presents classics and cutting-edge contemporary theatre – with English surtitles for some productions. 
  
Tickets
The perfect way to start an evening at the theatre – strolling across a spreading square, enjoying the elegant neo-classical architecture. The impressive façade of the Deutsches Theater Berlin is to the right and the Kammerspiele, dating from the early twentieth century, to the left. The centrally located Deutsches Theater restaurant is also ideal for relaxing before or after a show.
The theatre’s repertoire includes both traditional and modern classics from Chekhov to Sartre, Ibsen and Goethe – as well as many works by contemporary playwrights. Under artistic director Ulrich Khuon, the Deutsches Theater Berlin has also expanded its commitment to contemporary theatre, staging works by such modern playwrights as  Lukas Bärfuß, Dea Loher, Wolfram Lotz, Roland Schimmelpfennig, Ferdinand Schmalz and Nis-Momme Stockmann, and presenting many of these productions as world premières. Every spring, the Deutsches Theater also hosts the two-week Autorentheatertage festival of contemporary drama, underlining its aim of providing a new impetus to enrich modern German theatre.
The Deutsches Theater’s success only goes to confirm its approach. The Deutsches Theatre has frequently been invited to present its productions at the prestigious Theatertreffen festival. The Deutsches Theater and the Baracke des DT were already voted as theater of the year three times in the critics'' survey of the theater magazine '"Theater heute'". The Deutsches Theatre productions and the ensemble have won an array of prizes including, in October 2013, artistic director Ulrich Khuon’s award of the esteemed Max-Reinhardt-Ring, presented by the German Association of Stage Workers (GDBA).
The theatre has particularly supported collaborations with directors with distinctive styles, such as Andreas Kriegenburg, Stephan Kimmig, Stefan Pucher, Michael Thalheimer and Tom Kühnel/Jürgen Kuttner. The ensemble also includes many prominent actors in German theatre and media from Corinna Harfouch and Maren Eggert to Samuel Finzi, Susanne Wolff, Ulrich Matthes and Bernd Stempel.
In 1883, the Schumannstraße building became the home of the highly-acclaimed Deutsches Theater ensemble. Constructed in 1850 as the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Städtisches Theater, the stage was originally home to comedies and operettas. In contrast, the Deutsches Theater, founded by theatre critic Adolph L’Arronge, increasingly presented straight theatre, and has successfully retained that focus ever since.
The intimate auditorium of the main stage, which dates back to 1850, provides seating for 600. In 1906, then artistic director Max Reinhardt established the Kammerspiele in the neighbouring building. Specifically intended for modern drama, the Kammerspiele can seat audiences of up to 230. In 2006, the Deutsches Theater then added the Box, a third stage specifically for young directors to present new works and topical subjects. The compact black box stage, located in the Kammerspiele foyer, has around 80 seats.

Berlin local theatres and cabarets have a charm all their own. TiK Berlin is a bit off the beaten path.

For years, he has been filling the stage with a team of passionate artists who know how to entertain the audience with a sense of humour and impressive talent.

Tickets
Inclusive theatre provokes change

How does the saying go? Quality gets around. The extraordinary imagination and expressive force of the actors are an essential element of inclusive theatre. New ideas, imagery and scenes are created that would not be possible if artists with and without disabilities could not work together. They encourage us to think about forms of narrative and character portrayal in a different way.
The founders, Gisela Höhne and Klaus Erforth, are themselves the parents of a child with Down’s syndrome. In 1990, they founded the Sonnenuhr (sundial) association for their son Moritz and other people with disabilities, of which RambaZamba Theater is also a member.

  Entertaining adaptations of fairy tales with lovingly hand-made puppets and operas with marionettes provide fun for parents and children alike at Puppentheater Firlefanz.
  

Time seems to have come to a standstill at Sophienstraße 10 in Mitte, where parents and children have been entertained for over thirty years in this tiny neighbourhood theatre that only holds 30-40 people.
Harald Preuss founded the intimate Puppentheater Firlefanz for parents and children ages 3 and 4 in 1982. Preuss had trained at East Berlin''s acting school and came to be known as Mr Firlefanz by his audience during his previous twelve years'' performing at Puppentheater Berlin and also in Dresden. He still offers special puppet theatre experiences with his adaptations of fairy tales and other stories with well-known characters.
Afternoons, the little ones are treated to the likes of Cinderella(a fairy tale for children 4+), The Frog King (a love story for 5+), Puss in Boots (an adventure for 4+), and The Brave Little Tailor (with lots of action for 4+).
For adults and older children 6+, The Magic Flute, based on the opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is offered.
The puppets, sets, and marionettes have been lovingly hand-crafted for each piece by Barbara and Günter Weinhold in their small workshop in the Berlin district of Köpenick.
Harald Preuss also regularly does performances families, school groups, companies, and other private events upon request. But his entertaining tales have not been kept an exclusive Berlin secrete: Preuss has taken his mobile puppet theatre on the road for guest performances in Hungary, Italy, Austria, and Russia. Back in Berlin, Puppentheater Firlefanz also welcomes a guest performance once a month. So, for example, Peter and the Wolf , a musical fairy tale by Sergei Prokofiev, played here in May 2016. Most pieces last 50 minutes. The schedules can be found in the local press and in events guides.

1129,Hauptstadtoper - visitberlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/hauptstadtoper,"

  The Hauptstadtoper ensemble presents small productions, both its own pieces lovingly produced and twists on the classics. 
  

Opera should not be the expensive reserve of the upper classes. It should be for the people, so believe the professionals, amateurs, and lovers of the genre that support the work of the Hauptstadtoper. The goal is to create sung theatrical experiences that inspire and create a desire for more and even to pitch in. The team led by soprano Kristin Hasselmann produces their own evenings of sung performance, creating projects that rediscover the classics and début new works. Berlin''s smallest opera is not only creating something new from the classical repertoire, but also developing works commissioned for performance on its small stage.
The team also promotes the love of art and song to all who are interested, offering lessons in singing and stagecraft. It also offers coaching for singers.
Those who play an instrument or would like to learn one can sign up for any of the lessons in guitar, piano, cello, and more here. Beginners, enthusiasts, advanced learners, and professionals are all welcome to sign up for lessons here.
Musical theatre has so much to offer. The Hauptstadtoper offers an impressive array of events, from newly choreographed pieces and classics on stage to exhibitions and a cosy opera café. As you might image, a comparatively small ensemble with a large programme therefore needs a creative break from time to time. This is why the opera''s programme is a bit less extensive in 2016, with a shorter schedule and no new productions planned after the last major projects this year. The café also did not open its doors this year. The break is being used to identify new venues and partnerships with other theatres and theatre companies. New sponsors are also needed to take the Hauptstadtoper to the next level.
The Alte Feuerwache Friedrichshain is available as one cooperative partner and has invited the opera to perform its existing repertoire there once a month.

1130,Mehringhof-Theater | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/mehringhof-theater,"

  After all, the Kreuzbergers are never short of things to say, as proven at Mehringhof-Theater, five days a week. 
  
Tickets
The Mehringhof-Theater opened in 1985 as a venue for first-class comedy in Berlin''s Kreuzberg district. Five nights a week, newcomers take the stage alongside major stars of the stand-up comedy scene like Volker Pispers, Ingolf Lück, Dirk Bach, Ottfried Fischer, Kurt Krömer, and Ingo Appelt.
Many of the artists love to come '"home'" to the stage of the Mehringhof-Theater. Particularly legendary is its year-in-review programme. Since 1997, Christoph '"Chancellor Angela Merkel'" Jungmann reviews the past year''s events with razor-sharp contributions and perfectly choreographed ditties sung by comedians Bov Bjerg, Horst Evers, Manfred Maurenbrecher, and Hannes Heesch.
Berlin stars like Reinickendorfer Fil also perform their routines here on a regular basis. Maybe you know the comic strip Didi & Stulle, which has appeared in Berlin magazine Zitty since the mid-90s. Marc-Uwe Kling, who began his career on reading stages and poetry slams, also remains true to his Kreuzberg audience with new stories of the kangaroo.
The small Kreuzberg theatre only holds 250 people and tickets for the shows of well-known performers do sell out well in advance. Tickets can be purchased in all of the usual outlets, at the theatre box office, the bookstore Schwarze Risse, and by telephone. Our tip: show up early because the Mehringhof-Theater has general seating. Satire, comedy, music, or improve are all on the schedule.
The theatre''s name reflects its location in the Mehringhof, one of those Berlin rear courtyards that have been such a cauldron of creativity over the years. In the 1970s, the Mehringhof became a centre for alternative lifestyles where a variety of like-minded projects joined forces. A school for adult education was opened here. Besides the theatre, the Mehringhof is home to other Berlin institutions such as the Clash pub, the graphic design studio Graph Druckula, the bookstore Schwarze Risse, and even a cycling shop.
Good to know: if you''d like to catch a bite to eat before or after the show, it''s a just a couple of blocks to the Bergmannkiez neigbourhood, where you will find a selection of nice cafés and good food.

1132,GRIPS Theater - visitberlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/grips-theater,"

  The GRIPS is a streetwise theatre for young and old, where everyday problems are skilfully explored on stage. The team initiates many projects for schools.
  

Since the 1960s the GRIPS theatre in Mitte has been a creative pioneer, developing modern and contemporary plays for children and young people.
The concept developed by its founder Volker Ludwig was a complete success. He wanted to show real life, to offer young people prospects in life and to encourage them. What makes the theatre so popular is that it presents real problems in an artistic context. Its plays have been performed around the world over 1800 times in 50 countries and 40 languages.
Every year, the GRIPS theatre comes up with new ideas, performing four or five completely new plays. However, its repertoire also includes a number of old favourites which it constantly revisits with a fresh touch. These include Adams Welt, about a child who creates a life of his own in his imagination. With his own music, landscapes and underwater worlds, Adam takes us through his childhood dream.
Although the focus is usually on children and young people, there are also plays for adults. These include the cult musical Linie 1 about passengers on the (West) Berlin underground, ranging from Wilmersdorf widows to Kreuzberg punks. Since 2012, the programme for adults also includes Frau Müller muss weg, Lutz Hübner’s comedy about a parents’ evening, in a wonderful, lovingly directed production by the film-maker Sönke Wortmann.
As well as the main venue, the GRIPS theatre also has a smaller studio stage in the Podewil theatre on Klosterstraße.
There’s a lot going on off stage too. The GRIPS theatre pedagogy team researches phenomena and stories from childhood and youth, with the aim of exploring social topics using artistic means.
The theatre offers workshops and training courses, and maintains contacts with various initiatives and partners such as the August Bebel Institute and Jugendliche ohne Grenzen. There are also projects for schools and nurseries. The GRIPS theatre is bursting with energy and commitment! 
To make children’s and young people’s visit something lasting and special, experts from the GRIPS theatre help classes analyse what they have seen and experienced. In a playful way, scenes are analysed, and impressions are discussed and explored. The GRIPS team comes directly to schools in Berlin, while pupils from Brandenburg can look forward to a visit to the theatre.

Tickets
Berlin local theatres and cabarets have a charm all their own. TiK Berlin is a bit off the beaten path.
As a neighbourhood theatre in Berlin''s Neukölln district since 1987, TiK has developed a reputation as a popular cabaret with a penchant for drag shows and quirky performances. No longer in the basement, but now in a former shop, TiK has become an indispensable part of the scene. The theatre has made a name for itself well beyond the city limits and offers unusual performances and self-produced dance and musical numbers three nights a week,
all with a wink and a smile. Visitors in the front row should expect to be asked to join in and will be surprised how easily they can laugh about themselves. The founder of the theatre is actor Michael Brennecke, affectionately known as '"Mutter'", who directs the theatre''s ensemble. For years, he has been filling the stage with a team of passionate artists who know how to entertain the audience with a sense of humour and impressive talent.
The intimate atmosphere of the theatre is supported by the small gastrobar in the foyer. Table reservations for performances are accepted. You can relax and enjoy drinks, tapas, and Spanish food after the show.
During the 2016-17 season, TiK is celebrating its 30th anniversary with yet another lovingly created performance schedule. Visitors can expect many highlights from the past and amusing interpretations of past stories.
It does not always necessarily have to be a special occasion to visit TiK. It''s enough to be curious about passionate drag shows and neighbourhood entertainment that goes beyond the traditional.
The theatre is accessible and, upon request, seats with extra room can be reserved.

1154,Tempodrom | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/tempodrom,"

  A big top made of concrete, and under it comedy, a conference or a concert. Welcome to Berlin’s Tempodrom!
  
Tickets
The Tempodrom in Berlin hosts everything from opera choirs and comedians to compères and circus artists. Concerts, musicals, shows and conferences dominate the packed schedule under the imposing concrete and glass roof that looks like a circus tent.
Helge Schneider, Dieter Nuhr, the Pet Shop Boys and the Chippendales are only some of the many stars who entertain you here. The Tempodrom holds around 180 events a year – or if you like, there’s something on here every other day, and more than 350,000 visitors a year bear witness to that. It gets particularly full at Christmas, when the Tempodrom hosts the Roncalli Christmas Circus, and tickets to Holiday On Ice in the spring are also in great demand.
The new Tempodrom building at the Anhalter Bahnhof is one of the boldest buildings of recent years. The Tempodrom was founded on 1 May 1980, initially as a small circus tent on Potsdamer Platz, when Irene Moessinger spent her inheritance to realise a lifelong dream. It then moved to the Tiergarten and became famous for its concert and theatre programmes, characterised by an imaginative mix of genres. In particular, the Heimatklänge attracted large numbers of visitors every year. When Germany’s government moved to Berlin in the 1990s, the Tempodrom had to make way for the new buildings. While the new Tempodrom was being constructed, the tent moved to a temporary site near Ostbahnhof from 1999 to 2001.
The new building at Anhalter Bahnhof echoes the tent shape of the original Tempodrom, with a white, reinforced concrete roof structure reminiscent of the bold expressionist architecture of the 1920s. Inside, under the big top, there are two arenas, where events of all kinds are held, including concerts, theatre, revues, shows, circuses and sports.
Shortly afterwards, the Liquidrom moved into the building. It has numerous saunas and a relaxation zone where you can relax and rejuvenate. You can also enjoy the sensation of floating in salt water to ambient underwater sounds.
To get to the show or the concert, you get off at Anhalter Bahnhof (S-Bahn) or Möckernbrücke (U-Bahn). If you’re in the car, there is a paid car park at the Martin-Gropius-Bau, and multi-storey car parks at Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz. From there, it’s a few minutes’ walk to the Tempodrom.

  The Volksbühne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz – leading German film actors, experimental theatre and provocative productions, some even with English surtitles!
  
Tickets
The Volksbühne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz has a long tradition of bringing together well-known actors and experimental theatre – and is equally well known for its provocative productions, creating some major scandals in theatre history. The theatre not only stages its own productions, but has a number of long-standing cooperations, for instance, with the Gob Squad, a British-German collective based in Nottingham and Berlin. The major names regularly appearing at present on the stage of the Volksbühne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz include film actor Henry Hübchen as well as Alexander Scheer, Martin Wuttke, Sophie Rois and many others.
Aside from provocative and widely discussed critical explorations of contemporary issues and multimedia adaptations of novels, the productions by Christoph Marthaler, Christoph Schlingensief (†), Dimiter Gotscheff and René Pollesch have really made waves.
In line with the Volksbühne’s ‘expanded concept of theatre’, the programme also includes concerts, screenings, readings and literary events – which sometimes involves turning the theatre cafeteria into an unusual location for rehearsals or even a provisional stage!
In 1992, Frank Castorf was appointed as the Volksbühne’s artistic director. Under his directorship, the Volksbühne was voted twice as the theater of the year in the critics'' survey of the theater magazine '"Theater heute'". Klaus dörr currently holds the position of interim director of the theatre.
In addition to the theatre’s main auditorium, the Volksbühne has a number of venues and in-house stages, including the Roter and Grüner Salon and the Sternenfoyer, as well as a stage on the third floor and the more intimate Hinterbühne stage.
The Volksbühne, designed by Oskar Kaufmann, dates from 1914. Erwin Piscator, artistic director in the 1920s, was renowned for his controversial productions. His approach to theatre was also an important influence on Bertolt Brecht. During the Second World War, the theatre building was almost completely destroyed. In the early 1950s in what was then East Germany, the theatre was redesigned by Hans Richter and rebuilt. In East Germany, the Volksbühne developed into a modern director’s theatre, staging plays by prestigious writers such as Heiner Müller, and noted for its provocative productions by Benno Besson and Fritz Marquardt.
Some performances have English surtitles. For more details, check the programme in advance.
In the area around the Volksbühne, there is only limited parking.

  Werkstatt der Kulturen celebrates the artistic aspects of the city''s cultural diversity by organising major festivals and weekly events in its own inimitable style.
  

You meet people from all over the world in Berlin. And all contribute a bit of their culture, their traditions, and their life stories to the story of the city. Cultural differences shape, enrich, and challenge the life of the city. They also offer plenty of inspiration for art and cultural activities. The Werkstatt der Kulturen in Berlin shines a spotlight on this diversity and Berlin''s multiple cultural influences to celebrate it.
It organises events, both in its own event space in Berlin-Neukölln, or on the streets, such as the Carnival of Cultures in Kreuzberg. The latter is one of the most famous summer street festivals in Berlin, drawing thousands of Berliners and visitors to the streets of Kreuzberg each year to celebrate.
Werkstatt der Kulturen also regularly hosts jazz concerts, readings, dance performances, and even sometimes discussions on migration policy, just some of the 50 events they offer each month. Whenever possible, they invite participants to help shape the event or at least immerse themselves into the issues surrounding today''s urban and multicultural lifestyles. An exciting experience not just for people with similar cultural backgrounds, but also for all lovers of world music and diverse forms of artistic expression.
The Carnival of Cultures has been a fixture each Pentecost (Whitsunday) on Berlin''s calendar of events since 1996 and is one of the most successful and most colourful street festivals in the city. The streets of Kreuzberg become a giant dance floor and stage for a loud and lively presentation of various world cultures, their musical identities, and the pure joy of life itself. Music and dance groups perform along the streets from Hermannplatz to Mehringdamm for as many as 1.5 million spectators.
The Werkstatt launched the three-day Sacred Music & Dance Festival in 2013. This festival also celebrates Berlin and music and dance from around the world. The Global Drums Festival and Black History Month each February have also become established on the Berlin events calendar.
A lift is available upon request at Werkstatt der Kulturen; in the summer months, a garden ramp allows access into the building. A disabled toilet is available.
Ticket prices are fair and often free.

  Lovingly devised pieces for young and old alike in Berlin''s Charlottenburg district. Come on by!
  

Not far from Richard-Wagner-Platz at Luisenkirche, Puppentheater Berlin welcomes you to its lovely and intimate venue. About 70 children at matinees and about 50 adults in the evenings can fit into the tiny theatre.
Puppentheater Berlin was founded in the heart of West Berlin in 1984. It has since been thrilling audiences young and old with every form of puppet theatre, including hand puppets and marionettes, shadow plays and mask theatre, and even conventional dramas. What sets Puppentheater Berlin apart is the musical accompaniment provided for almost every performance. Musicians from the local conservatory accompany performances with piano, violin, cello, saxophone, and many other instruments.
Puppentheater Berlin has an extensive repertoire, including 20 pieces for children and 6 productions for adults. For the youngest guests between 30 months and 5 years of age, pieces like  Frühling, Sommer, Herbst und Winter, Hänschen Klein, Komm Spiel mit mir, Der Herbst and Weihnachten are on offer. The little ones are invited to get involved in making the music and singing along.

There are 15 productions in the repertoire for children between the ages of 4 and 8,  for example, Karneval der Tiere, a piece about proud lions, wild donkeys, a dancing elephant, and a surprise guest from ancient times. This has been one the theatre''s biggest hits in recent years.  Hansel and Gretel makes for a wonderful theatrical experience and not just during the festive season before Christmas. The theatre also performs Der Hase und der Igel , a piece about a rabbit and a hedgehog that''s been a hit when taken on the road to Japan, Korea, Italy, Austria, and Denmark.
For older kids ages eight and up, there are five pieces to choose from: Das fröhliche Landmahl,  Zehn Minuten bis Buffallo, Bilder einer Ausstellung, Sophie-Charlotte and Das Fuchsgericht. The latter is a show that the Puppentheater has successfuly toured in the US, Denmark, Austria, and at many German theatre festivals.
Adults are treated to some puppet theatre, too, with shows like Faust, Herbstabend, Humperdinck, Deutsche Balladen and Das Fräulein von Scuderi providing a good mix of pieces from different genres.
The audience says: '"wonderful, imaginative, poetic, lovingly arranged, excellently staged. Just simply VERY RECOMMEND! '"

  Magic shows staged by Russian magician Igor Jedlin offer brilliant entertainment for young and old alike.
  
Tickets
Illusions and magic have long delighted audiences of all ages. Fascinated by the idea of things disappearing or levitating, children and adults will be whisked away to another world by the magic of Igor Jedlin. In his small magic theatre in Berlin''s Charlottenburg district, the magician takes the audience on a journey into the realm of fantasy.
Igor Jedlin is a magician of the old school, complete with wand and top hat, and has performed for kings and presidents.  Growing up in Moscow, he discovered his interest in magic when he was just four and was taken to watch a small travelling circus. He attended the Moscow Academy of Circus Arts and then joined the Moscow State Circus, where he performed for thirteen years.
In 1978, he founded his own magic theatre. With his magic shows Zauberhits für Kids and the Wunderwelt der Magie, the Russian magician will fascinate kids and adults alike in the only year-round magic theatre in all of Europe, located here in Berlin on Kurfürstendamm. A childhood dream that Igor Jedlin has been living for 38 years now.
Every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday afternoon, children will be whisked away into the wonderful world of magic. Adults might prefer to check out Jedlin''s grand magic at one of his evening performances. A really entertaining experience. Very loving, humorous, and occasionally bizarre is what visitors report of their experiences. Ticket reservations can be made directly on the website.

1180,Wintergarten Varieté | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/wintergarten-variete,"

  The Wintergarten is home to great entertainment – music, variety, dance and shows. Discover an irresistible mix of acrobatics, sketches and surprises!
  
Tickets
As the house lights slowly fade, a glittering canopy of stars appears. A single spotlight shines on the empty stage. Suddenly, held just by a thin rope, an acrobat swings into the light. The audience gasps in amazement – and the Wintergarten show has begun!
For over twenty years, the Wintergarten has been renowned for its breathtaking acrobatic acts and lively revue shows. In the very best tradition, the theatre mixes acrobats, comedy, live music, dance and top performers in excitingly different shows across the broad variety spectrum – but whatever the mix, the result is a high-energy cocktail of top variety entertainment definitely not to be missed!
In the great tradition of variety theatre, the Wintergarten also offers refreshments for shows, from snacks and drinks to a three-course set meal. Special evening shows include the popular murder mystery dinner, where guests can solve the crime. The afternoon ShowCafé appeals to the entire family, with tea, coffee and cakes served with selected highlights from the evening programme.
The Wintergarten programme has a broad appeal – wherever you come from! Since the majority of acts use very little dialogue, there’s no need to speak German to have a great night out!
In today’s Wintergarten, the charm of past eras is vibrantly alive. The auditorium, with its canopy of stars, plush red velvet and dark wood, has a uniquely evocative atmosphere. Display cases with costumes and props also offer an insight into this theatre’s long tradition. The Wintergarten is intimately linked to that vibrant tradition of entertainment which has given Berlin its formidable reputation for nightlife, theatres and shows. In 1887, a variety theatre was opened in a ‘winter garden’ at the Hotel Central in Friedrichstraße – and soon witnessed an event that made history! One evening in 1895, rather than acrobats and exotic dancers on stage, the theatre hosted a world première. At this first-ever commercial screening of a film, the Skladanowsky brothers presented the sensational new art of cinematography!
After various make-overs, the Wintergarten became one of Europe’s largest and most modern theatres – and already had it legendary canopy of stars. In the 1920s, with variety theatre booming, the Wintergarten was synonymous with the wild Roaring Twenties, presenting a series of stunning revue and variety shows.
During the Second World War, the Wintergarten was severely damaged. In 1944, the theatre had to close but, for Berliners, the name and spirit it embodied lived on. And in 1992, a new Wintergarten theatre in Potsdamer Straße revived this great theatre tradition. This also ushered in a new era, since the site had previously been home to the Club Quartier Latin, a venue legendary for concerts with Berlin’s punk bands in the 1970s and 80s.
With the fall of the Wall and reunification, there was also a sea change in Berlin’s nightlife – and it was a fitting moment for the Wintergarten to successfully revive the glitz and glamour of the 1920s on a Berlin stage.
Wintergarten Varieté does not have its own parking facilities. However, there is a car park in a nearby side street off Potsdamer Strasse (parking charges apply).

1181,Pfefferberg Theater | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/pfefferberg-theater,"

  Kleist and Molière and old brick walls: Pfefferberg takes you back to the time of classic theatre. 
  
Tickets
What was the theatre in the time of Molière or Kleist like? Maybe audiences gathered in spaces with old brick walls like those found at the Pfefferberg Theater. Actors perform classic plays in this former brewery pub at the Pfefferberg dating back to 1841. Plays include Kleist''s Der Zerbrochene Krug ('"The Broken Jug'") and Molière''s Der Geizige ('"The Miser'"). The setting might be historic, but it''s not lacking for comfort, thanks to the armchairs covered in plush, red velvet.
Going back more than twenty years, the Ensemble HexenBerg und MärchenBerg now takes the stage at the Pfefferberg. In 1994, the ensemble started as the Hexenkessel Hoftheater in the rear courtyard of a squat on Schönhauser Allee. In 1999, they moved to Monbijoupark and became famous for pieces performed in the amphitheatre and fairy tale cottages there. In 2015, they finally opened their space at the Pfefferberg Theater. In the summer, they perform stage classics, while they keep up the tradition of telling fairy tales in the winter.
Pfefferberg Theater is a project where people with and without disabilities collaborate, both on stage and behind the scenes. VIA Schankhallen Pfefferberg gGmbH, a group of organisations for people with disabilities, operates the theatre. The highlight of the year is the Pariété Gala where well-known artists show enthusiastic audiences just how inclusive cultural production can be.
Tickets for all performances are available at the box office, by phone, or online. The website also contains the current performance schedule. The Pfefferberg Theater can be reached from the U2 station at Sennefelderplatz. An accessible entrance to the Pfefferberg is available off of Christinenstraße.
The Pfefferberg Theater complex also includes the Pfefferbräu restaurant. Perfect for a beer before or after after the show. The beers are brewed on the premises, with your choice of a Helles (lager), Dunkles (dark), or Weizen (wheat). And it tastes even better in the beer garden overlooking the historic brewery courtyard. Brunch and snacks are also on the menu. And, to keep the fun lasting even longer, you can dance to the tango in the pub hall with URQUIZA | Tango Argentino.

1188,Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/pierre-boulez-saal-berlin,"

  Built thanks to Daniel Barenboim''s initiative, the Pierre Boulez Saal offers its audiences an intimate auditory experience. 
  
Tickets
The concert hall was designed upon the initiative of Daniel Barenboim, General Music Director of the Berlin State Opera, and in collaboration with the American architect Frank Gehry. The hall’s acoustics concept is the work of Japanese acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota. The building’s original façade, designed by Richard Paulick in the 1950s, was preserved as a listed building. The location formerly housed the State Opera’s backdrops warehouse. 
The French composer and conductor Pierre Boulez (1925 to 2016), a friend of Barenboim’s for many years and the namesake of the concert hall, viewed music’s essential function as the forging of a connection between musicians and listeners. One of the hall’s core elements is thus the closeness of the audience to the musicians – not seated on a raised dais, the musicians face the audience directly at eye level. To Boulez, music was a means of direct communication which demanded careful, attentive listening.
The concert hall, panelled in lightly coloured cedar, has a flexible design offering variable setups: The audience’s seating and the stage can be moved to form different layouts. Examples include an arena layout or a classic concert hall with the audience facing the stage at the front. Stalls and galleries together form the visual of two interlocking ellipses. 
The Pierre Boulez Saal is also the venue for concerts played by the Barenboim-Said Academy. Since October 2016, young musicians from conflict zones in the Middle East have found a place to study music here. The orchestra was founded in 1999 by Daniel Barenboim and Edward Said. The orchestra’s name was inspired by Goethe’s collection of poems “West–Eastern Divan”, itself inspired by Middle Eastern poetry. The Barenboim-Said Academy’s building was designed by the architects HG Merz and rw+.
The Pierre Boulez Saal brings studies and practical experience together. Students are given the opportunity to advance their knowledge and skills through learning and giving concerts, under the tutelage of professionals.
Since March 2017, the hall has regularly hosted concerts and chamber music performances. The programme features contemporary works and the Classical and Romantic repertoire. The hall is also used for lectures and conferences.
At the same time as concert hosting began, a new ensemble was founded. The Boulez Ensemble comprises musicians from the Staatskapelle Berlin and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra.

  The Hackesche Höfe are one of Berlin’s most popular attractions – don’t miss the impressive Art Nouveau façades and the special atmosphere!
  

No visit to Berlin is complete without a trip to the Hackesche Höfe. Ever since reunification they have been one of the main meeting points for scenesters and tourists alike. The complex is in the historical Scheunenviertel area of Spandauer Vorstadt in Mitte. They are the largest single courtyard complex in Germany and have been listed buildings since 1972. 
In the 17th century, the area where the Hackesche Höfe are now located wasn’t even part of Berlin. There were lots of barns there for storing hay and straw, which couldn’t be kept in the city because of the fire risk. Although the area around Hackescher Markt has long since been part of the city centre, it’s still called the Scheunenviertel (Barn Quarter) today.  
By 1700, many people had settled outside the city walls in the area that became known as the Spandauer Vorstadt. It even had its own church. In 1731 it became part of Berlin when the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm I had the city walls extended. Shortly afterwards, Hackescher Markt was build according to the plans of the city commandant Hans Christoph Graf von Hacke. 
Jewish residents in particular settled in the area around Hackescher Markt in the following years, and a vibrant Jewish community developed. The Jewish cemetery was opened on Große Hamburger Straße, and in 1866 the synagogue was built on Oranienburger Straße, where it still stands today. 
The courtyard complex opposite Hackescher Markt was opened on 23 September 1906 after several years of construction. It was designed and built by the architect Kurt Berndt, and the Art Nouveau façade was the work of August Endell. As with many Berlin courtyard buildings, the complex is used for a mixture of offices, shops, workshops (particularly in the front courtyards) and flats. 
The buildings were only partially damaged during the Second World War, but became increasingly dilapidated while Germany was partitioned. They were state property in the GDR and neglected at the time. 
Only after reunification, starting in 1993, was the complex extensively restored at a cost of 80 million deutschmarks, and it soon became a magnet for tourists.
The original use of the buildings was included in the restoration concept and successfully implemented. Today, the eight courtyards of the Hackesche Höfe between Rosenthaler Straße and Sophienstraße have 27,000 square metres of space for 40 businesses, including cultural institutions, a cinema, cafés, shops and apartments. 
All around the Hackesche Höfe, bars, restaurants and clubs have opened, and the area is now one of Berlin’s most popular places for nightlife.

The courtyards with apartments are closed at night, but the front courtyards with bars, the cinema and theatres are always open. 
It’s always busy around the Hackesche Höfe and Hackescher Markt, and there is hardly anywhere to park. We therefore recommend getting there by public transport. The S-Bahn, U-Bahn, trams and buses all stop at Hackescher Markt.

  In June 2015, the Kunsthaus Dahlem is opening in Berlin’s Grunewald area, near the Brücke Museum.
  

The Kunsthaus Dahlem has an explosive history – built during the Nazi era, the Arno Breker State workshop is now an exhibition space for post-war modernism. It is originally intended to house sculptures for Hitler''s Germania project. Sculptor Bernhard Heiliger moves in here after the war, followed by other artists. You can see Heiliger''s sculptures in the sculpture garden attched to the museum. The studio is an exhibition space for post-war art of the East and West.
Arno Breker comes to prominence in Nazi Germany when Adolf Hitler admires his sculptures. Breker, working with Albert Speer, accompanies Hitler to Paris and builds monumental sculptures that he hopes would adorn Berlin in the future. He is given his own studio which is now Kunsthaus Dahlem. After the war, it''s occupied by the Americans and, shortly thereafter, Berlin''s sculptors once more. The first such artist, Bernhard Heiliger, moves there in 1949 and stays for 46 years creating almost the entirety of the Sculpture Garden behind the house. The studios are also a haven for other artists such as Emilio Vedova and Wolf Vostell. By 2013, Kunsthaus Dahlem has become a workplace for artists from all over the world – sometimes housing those with scholarships from the DAAD.
Today, the studios are closed – opened in 2015 as an exhibition venue for post-war modernism. You can see sculptures, paintings and photography. Managed by the Bernhard Heiliger Foundation, exhibitions focus on the years between 1945 and 1961. A considerable renovation has been implemented by Berlin''s former mayor, Klaus Wowereit. You will first catch sight of the high brick facade of the building, surrounded by the green fringes of Grunewald forest. The main studio is approximately 300 square metres in size. There are high windows – nine metres from the floor to ceiling – letting in plenty of light. Just as high are the wooden doors in the monumental style of the NS architects. In the middle of the room, you are led up a spiral staircase to the gallery. On the white limestone walls are photographs or paintings, depending on the exhibition. Sculptures form the focal point. Kunsthaus Dahlem always exhibits major shows for longer periods. In addition, four times a year there is a new temporary exhibition.
Directly across from the Kunsthaus Dahlem, you can see the Brücke Museum. Since the 1960s, works by a group of artists have been exhibited here. These include expressionist painting by Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Max Pechstein. Max Liebermann is influenced by impressionism. Learn more about him at the Liebermann Villa am Wannsee which is the artist''s summer residence from around 1920. The permanent exhibition presents more than 200 paintings and pastels of his garden - all created in this villa.
The easiest way to arrive is to take the underground line U3 to the station Dahlem-Dorf. From here, take bus 115 to Finkestraße. It''s about a five minute walk to the Kunsthaus Dahlem. The museum is closed on Tuesdays. You can purchase discount tickets in combination with the adjacent Brücke Museum. Guided tours are possible and limited to 30 people. Entry is free for children and young people under 18.

  Danger, high voltage! This impressive three-storey building on Palisadenstraße is one of the oldest references to Berlin''s power supply system. 
  

It was from here that the neighbouring districts were supplied with power until the plant''s closure in 1945. Culture behind the listed façade Today''s visitors to the Umspannwerk Ost (meaning Substation East) can expect excitement, entertainment and great food: behind the listed historic façade lies the Berliner-Kriminal-Theater (''Criminal'' Theatre), the theatre and jazz club with its own '"dinner show'" and a restaurant. The restoration of the building was respectful of its history, so its former use as a substation is easily recognisable throughout: wide machine halls on which steel beams are aligned and six meter high gates made from steel and glass and flooded with light, as well as the undivided levels in the top floors and the clinker brick walls. Hints of the building''s previous industrial use Set back from the building line by around ten meters, this building was originally built for use as a substation between 1899 and 1900 according to designs by architect Oskar Springmann. It was modified soon after in 1908. The street-side façade style uses elements of Renaissance architecture and conveys the message that this building is intended for business. The large round arched windows in the machine hall on the ground floor are evidence of the building''s technical nature.

Berlin''s vibrant theatre scene truly caters to all tastes.

With fun and inspiring shows for kids of all ages, the Berlin Kinder Theater is a firm family favourite, as is the Grips-Theater, located at Hansaplatz. Don''t worry if you don''t speak German as many Berlin theatres have selected performances featuring English surtitles. What''s more, the English Theatre Berlin stages excellent English-language dramas at their own theatre in Berlin''s Kreuzberg district."

1284,Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/kunstraum-kreuzbergbethanien,"

  A former hospital, today you''ll find Bethanien one of Kreuzberg''s most established contemporary studio come arts spaces.
  

Bethanien Hospital, ever a hotspot of the alternative, was a centre for the squatter scene in the early 70s. Today, it has morphed into art space Kreuzberg/Bethanien - an open cultural forum that combines artist''s studios and contemporary exhibitions. Walking tours, workshops and films are also on the programme at Kreuzberg''s oldest building.
Bethanien Hospital is opened in 1847 under Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. It endures as the most important hospital and barracks in Kreuzberg but loses its importance after the Second World War. Its closing in 1970 sparks a heated debate about its future by leftist activists, preservationists and a citizens initiative for nurses. Bethanien becomes known as Georg-von-Rauch-Haus in memory of an activist who perishes in a confrontation with the police. Bethanien is not only the focus of the squatter scene but a cultural epicentre. It gives rise to the German cult singer Rio Reiser and from 1970 onwards births collaborative projects between residents, artists and the politically engaged. Today, Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien is still a forum for a variety of contemporary art exhibitions and a packed events programme. Visit contemporary art exhibitions, discussions and artists talks for free. Regular Open Studios tours offer access to the individually designed artists'' studios. Curators of the art space also offer films and guided tours. Shows focus on street art, photography, sound installations and media art. A former library on the ground floor is now a project space, and the first and second floors are occupied by temporary exhibitions. Studio 2 is a rehearsal space for actors and dancers. Enjoy a colourful programme of open-air cinema in the grounds behind Bethanien in the summer.
At Moritzplatz, just a few minutes away from the Bethanien, stands the artists'' club Scotty Enterprises. The smallest house in Kreuzberg organises international and German gallery exhibitions and performances. 14 artists manage the art space independent of a commercial focus, taking a similar approach as one of Germany''s largest art associations, New Society of Visual Art, nGbK, which was founded in 1969. In the former safe factory, you can hear political and socio-critical lectures, discussions and artist talks. The nGbK offers visitors a varied international programme, and they have a well assorted book shop.
Take the Metro U1 to Görlitzer Bahnhof or Kottbusser Tor. From here, you are just ten minutes walk away from Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien at Mariannenplatz. Alternatively, take the U8 to Moritzplatz, about 15 minutes away. Bethanien is open every day, and normal admission is free. On request, you can participate in guided tours of the gallery and studios. The art space Kreuzberg/Bethanien operates several partnerships with schools in Berlin. The district authority of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg regularly offers learning opportunities through special projects, internships and workshops.

  May we perform a poem for you? Listen to poetry at the Haus für Poesie.
  

Berlin''s poetry and literary scene has found a home behind the red brick walls of the Kulturbrauerei, a former brewery in Prenzlauer Berg. The Haus für Poesie, the former Literaturwerkstatt Berlin, is place for writing and other creative arts. Contemporary poetry and writing, often in conjunction with other arts such as photography and film. The finished verses are then presented at some 150 events a year. Come to experience poetry in its original form as spoken word.
Budding writers have the chance to present their work to an audience at the Haus für Poesie. The Open Mike competition is the most important literary contest in Germany outside the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, but this one is directed exclusively at the next generation. And that has always been a part of the concept: discovering and promoting literary talents. This is a place not just to admire the established stars of the literary scene, but also to discover writers who have (not yet) had their big break.
The programming makes the house an important stage for contemporary literature. In addition to the Open Mike Competition, the Haus für Poesie also offers other regular events:
Since it was founded in 1991, the Haus für Poesie (respectively Literaturwerkstatt) has recorded almost all of its events, including readings, discussions, and conversations with the authors. Thanks to this initiative, the Literaturwerkstatt now has an extensive collection of sound recordings that can be accessed online at lyrikline.org. More than 9,000 poems by more than 1,000 authors writing in 64 languages have been recorded.
They say each of us has a writer inside! The Haus für Poesie regularly organises poetry workshops for children, teachers, and aspiring poets of all ages. And who knows, maybe you''ll even take the stage some night and perform your poem before the open mike audience.

1305,Sammlung Boros | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/sammlung-boros,"

  The converted bunker stands like a gloomy block on the corner of Reinhardtstrasse and Albrechtstrasse, not far from the Deutsches Theater in Berlin’s Mitte district. Inside, it hides an incredible treasure trove of contemporary art – sculpture, spatial installations, light and performance-based work of international standing. 
  

But how do you find your way into this fabulous collection behind metre-thick walls? There are no signs telling you which way to go, no reference at all to this being a museum. It is home to the private Boros Collection, which has been housed here since June 2008 when the building opened after extensive renovation work. Collector Christian Boros lives with his family in the upper section of the bunker, while the lower floors house the collection. It consists of around 500 works in total by artists such as Damian Hirst, Olafur Eliasson, Wolfgang Tillmans, Anselm Reyle, Manfred Pernice, Tobias Rehberger and John Bock. The Boros Collection can only be viewed on extended weekends as part of a guided tour, which you’ll need to book in advance via the website. It’s certainly worthwhile! This really is a great way to experience art away from the major museums and exhibition centres.
The hanging Boros # 3 shows since 2017 works by Martin Boyce, Andreas Eriksson, Guan Xiao, He Xiangyu, Uwe Henneken, Yngve Holen, Sergej Jensen, Daniel Josefsohn, Friedrich Kunath, Michel Majerus, Fabian Marti, Kris Martin, Justin Matherly, Paulo Nazareth, Peter Piller, Katja Novitskova, Pamela Rosenkranz, Avery Singer, Johannes Wohnseifer.

Flutgraben e.V. is a association in an approximately 3800 square meters big building managing about 50 artist studios accommodating more than 80 artists from all over the world. The house also disposes of two large common spaces: a project space of about 220qm, in which different artistic events take place and a multi purpose hall of equal size in use by tenants of the house.

1318,Haus am Lützowplatz (House on Lützowplatz) - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/haus-am-lutzowplatz-house-lutzowplatz,"
One of Berlin''s main cultural centres is housed in a 19th-century building on Lützowplatz. A venue for contemporary art, the House hosts works by both German and international artists. Many different genres of art are exhibited, from photography and painting to cutting-edge conceptual art. Complementing the programme of events are regular film screenings, performances and talks from international personalities from the worlds of culture, business, art and science. Yet the House on Lützowplatz is not only for established figures from the art scene. On the contrary, it gives a platform to emerging artistic and curatorial talent. Attracting a diverse audience, the centre hosts up to eight different exhibitions annually.
In 1873, architect Wilhelm Neumann starts work on his house with its striking neo-baroque façade on Lützowplatz, one of Berlin''s most attractive squares. After Jewish families are evicted from their properties in 1938, the building is taken over by an association of Berlin artists. In 1943, it is damaged heavily in bombing raids. During the post-war era, it is rebuilt and in 1950, Lützowplatz cultural centre opens. This new Berlin art institution focuses on classic modernist paintings by the likes of Chagall or Kokoschka. Leading social democrats and trade unionists from West Berlin found an arts promotion association in 1961, with the aim of breathing life into the cultural world of Berlin. This new association buys the building known as House on Lützowplatz and begins to develop it from a cultural club to a wider centre for contemporary art and social discussions. In the House on Lützowplatz you will find modern artworks within 19th-century interiors. The entrance to the building gives a good flavour of what the house is about. Leading into the house via what used to be a window is a metal staircase sculpture by Volkmar Haase. Inside, there are two main exhibition rooms, featuring their original baroque interiors. In total, there is 240 square metres of exhibition space available in the front building. The bright rooms of this former mansion allow visitors to experience works in a relaxed and private atmosphere. The smaller rooms in the side wings usually host smaller exhibitions. Another outstanding feature of the house is its courtyard garden which strikes the perfect balance between tranquil back garden and modern art space.
Just 400 metres from the House on Lützowplatz is the Bauhaus Archive, a design museum which is devoted to the 20th-century Bauhaus movement in art, design and architecture. At the Archive you can find out about famous teachers and students, and learn about the influence of the Bauhaus. You can also see the world''s largest collection of objects connected to the famed movement. Located just around the corner on Lützowstraße, the Gay Museum explores LGBT identity, culture and history. The museum hosts regular temporary exhibitions, and has an extensive library covering more than 1,600 square metres.
The House on Lützowplatz can be easily reached by public transport: simply take the U1, U2, U3 or U4 underground lines to Nollendorfplatz. From here, it is a seven minute walk to your destination. Alternatively, take bus lines 100, 106, 187 or M29 straight to Lützowplatz. Admission is free, except for special events.

1425,3 days in Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/3-days-berlin,"
Are you in Berlin for the first time and don’t want to miss out on any of the highlights in this exciting city? Our 72-hour tour will take you to the most famous landmarks in Berlin and to its most beautiful places. Be guided through a sightseeing tour of Mitte, go shopping on Kurfürstendamm and in City West, and experience neighbourhood life in the districts of Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain. With our 72-hour programme, you won’t miss out on any top sights during your first visit to Berlin.
Start your first day in Berlin at the World Clock at Alexanderplatz. Let the surrounding buildings take you back in time to the GDR of the 1970s, watch the lively goings-on as people pass by and look up across the S-Bahn railway tracks at the TV Tower, the first highlight on the tour. From the top you’ll have a phenomenal view over the whole city, and with the Berlin WelcomeCard you can enjoy a discount on the admission price to the tower. Eat up the view while enjoying breakfast or brunch at the restaurant sphere that rotates over Berlin at a height of 200 metres.
Tickets for the TV Tower
You can continue the tour westwards, past the Rotes Rathaus (red town hall), where the Berlin mayor’s office is. Berlin’s oldest district, the Nikolaiviertel, awaits your visit by the Spree. You can stroll around the picturesque neighbourhood surrounding St. Nicholas’ Church. A bit further downstream of the river on the other side you’ll find the Berlin Cathedral with its gigantic dome – one of Berlin’s landmarks and something you most definitely should not miss.

Museum Island is not only a top Berlin attraction for art lovers. This ensemble consists of five museums that are on UNESCO’s list of world heritage sites. The Altes Museum, the Neues Museum, the Pergamon Museum, the Bode Museum and the Alte Nationalgalerie together form one of the most important museum complexes in the world, and you have free entrance to them with the Berlin WelcomeCard.
Buy your Berlin Welcome Card Museum Island
Back on the magnificent Unter den Linden boulevard, you can see the Berlin City Palace, still under construction, on the left behind the Schlossbrücke (palace bridge). Over Bebelplatz and St. Hedwig’s Cathedral which is a little hidden behind the Staatsoper Unter den Linden (Berlin State Opera), the journey continues with a short detour to Gendarmenmarkt, surely the most beautiful square in Berlin. Enjoy the harmonious ensemble of the concert house in the centre, flanked by the German and French cathedrals, from one of the many restaurants and cafés around the square.
Charlottenstraße on the western side of the square and then Behrenstraße going westwards will now lead you past the Komische Oper to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, which is also known as the Holocaust Memorial. Walk through the memorial with its 2,711 concrete pillars and take in its contemplative atmosphere.
 
 
From here it’s just a few metres down Ebertstraße before you’ll find yourself in front of the most famous landmark of Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate. Few buildings are as closely connected with the history of Berlin as the former city gate is. After the fall of the Berlin Wall it became a symbol of German unity. Following a short walk around Pariser Platz the tour continues through the gate onto the Platz des 18. März. Now you’ll be able to recognise the Siegessäule (Victory Column) in the distance, in the centre of the large Tiergarten park.
The next highlight of our tour is also a truly historic place. The Reichstag, the seat of the Deutscher Bundestag (German parliament), has not only had an eventful history since the Reichstag fire in 1933. You can book a guided tour through the dome – the Alte-Fritz adventure tour is especially worthwhile.
To finish off the tour we recommend either a drink at Capital Beach, directly on the riverbank of the Spreebogenpark with a view of the main railway station – or a beer at Zollpackhof on the other side of the Spree. From there you can also comfortably reach Hackescher Markt, where you can spend the evening at any one of the numerous restaurants, cafés and bars.
Begin your second day like royalty, with a stroll around Charlottenburg Palace. Initially constructed as a summer palace, today it is the most splendid palace in Berlin, with extensive gardens. Located directly by the Spree, you’ll feel like you’ve been transported back in time to the rococo period and the days of the Prussian kingdom as you stroll through the park.
 
A short ride from there on the U7 metro will take you directly to Adenauerplatz in the middle of the legendary Kurfürstendamm – the most famous shopping street in Berlin. Here you can peruse the latest designer fashions or simply marvel at the impressive building façades during your walk along the boulevard. The next highlight is waiting for you at the end of the Ku’damm: the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche (Memorial Church) on Breitscheidplatz. The ensemble consists of the ruins of the church destroyed in the war and a new building next to it. It is a monument for peace and reconciliation and a symbol of Berliners’ will to rebuild in the post-war period.
Today the church is encircled by several tall buildings such as the Upper West, the Zoofenster and the Europa Center, the oldest shopping centre in Berlin. You can reach Kaufhaus des Westens at Wittenbergplatz in just a few minutes via the adjacent Tauentzienstraße. KaDeWe is the most famous department store in Germany. Ansbacher Straße and Kurfürstenstraße will take you to Olof-Palme-Platz. And here waiting for you at the end of the tour are two more highlights: Zoologischer Garten and the Aquarium Berlin, that you can gain reduced admission to with the Berlin WelcomeCard.
You can round off the day right next door, at the Monkey Bar in the 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin. The cocktail bar with panoramic windows offers you a breathtaking view over Tiergarten and City West. Alternatively, you can retreat to the Schleusenkrug on warm summer evenings, a cosy beer garden directly on the Landwehr Canal in Tiergarten.
Enjoy an easy-going start on the third day with a late brunch the way the Berliners love them. Things taste even better when there is a view to match. So check out one of the many cafés by the Landwehr Canal or the Neuköllner Schifffahrtskanal (Neukölln Ship Canal). You can then digest your brunch on a walk along the canal. There are unique gems in the way of restaurants, bars and clubs awaiting your visit. Freischwimmer, Club der Visionäre, Badeschiff and IPSE are just four of the locations on the island that form a summertime bar biotope on the left and right of the Flutgraben channel.
Schlesische Straße and Falckensteinstraße then lead you to Oberbaumbrücke, surely the most picturesque bridge in Berlin. From here you have one of the most beautiful views of Berlin in both directions – towards Alexanderplatz with the TV Tower and out of the city with the Molecule Men in the Spree.
 
 
Just around the corner from Oberbaumbrücke you’ll find the East Side Gallery stretching out before you. The longest connected piece of the former Berlin Wall is covered with many different and amazing artworks. The most famous painting is the brotherly kiss between Honecker and Brezhnev. And there are plenty more historic events depicted along the 1.3 km open air gallery.
Over Schillingbrücke, Bethaniendamm and Mariannenplatz you can continue on until Oranienstraße. From Heinrichplatz to Moritzplatz there are so many bars and restaurants that there is certain to be something to suit all tastes. You can review your stay in Berlin over a beer, wine or cocktail. And for those who wish to venture deeper into the night: the legendary SO36, Prince Charles and Ritter Butzke are just three places for an fun-filled club night.

1481,3 days in Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/3-days-berlin,"
Are you in Berlin for the first time and don’t want to miss out on any of the highlights in this exciting city? Our 72-hour tour will take you to the most famous landmarks in Berlin and to its most beautiful places. Be guided through a sightseeing tour of Mitte, go shopping on Kurfürstendamm and in City West, and experience neighbourhood life in the districts of Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain. With our 72-hour programme, you won’t miss out on any top sights during your first visit to Berlin.
Start your first day in Berlin at the World Clock at Alexanderplatz. Let the surrounding buildings take you back in time to the GDR of the 1970s, watch the lively goings-on as people pass by and look up across the S-Bahn railway tracks at the TV Tower, the first highlight on the tour. From the top you’ll have a phenomenal view over the whole city, and with the Berlin WelcomeCard you can enjoy a discount on the admission price to the tower. Eat up the view while enjoying breakfast or brunch at the restaurant sphere that rotates over Berlin at a height of 200 metres.
Tickets for the TV Tower
You can continue the tour westwards, past the Rotes Rathaus (red town hall), where the Berlin mayor’s office is. Berlin’s oldest district, the Nikolaiviertel, awaits your visit by the Spree. You can stroll around the picturesque neighbourhood surrounding St. Nicholas’ Church. A bit further downstream of the river on the other side you’ll find the Berlin Cathedral with its gigantic dome – one of Berlin’s landmarks and something you most definitely should not miss.

Museum Island is not only a top Berlin attraction for art lovers. This ensemble consists of five museums that are on UNESCO’s list of world heritage sites. The Altes Museum, the Neues Museum, the Pergamon Museum, the Bode Museum and the Alte Nationalgalerie together form one of the most important museum complexes in the world, and you have free entrance to them with the Berlin WelcomeCard.
Buy your Berlin Welcome Card Museum Island
Back on the magnificent Unter den Linden boulevard, you can see the Berlin City Palace, still under construction, on the left behind the Schlossbrücke (palace bridge). Over Bebelplatz and St. Hedwig’s Cathedral which is a little hidden behind the Staatsoper Unter den Linden (Berlin State Opera), the journey continues with a short detour to Gendarmenmarkt, surely the most beautiful square in Berlin. Enjoy the harmonious ensemble of the concert house in the centre, flanked by the German and French cathedrals, from one of the many restaurants and cafés around the square.
Charlottenstraße on the western side of the square and then Behrenstraße going westwards will now lead you past the Komische Oper to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, which is also known as the Holocaust Memorial. Walk through the memorial with its 2,711 concrete pillars and take in its contemplative atmosphere.
 
 
From here it’s just a few metres down Ebertstraße before you’ll find yourself in front of the most famous landmark of Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate. Few buildings are as closely connected with the history of Berlin as the former city gate is. After the fall of the Berlin Wall it became a symbol of German unity. Following a short walk around Pariser Platz the tour continues through the gate onto the Platz des 18. März. Now you’ll be able to recognise the Siegessäule (Victory Column) in the distance, in the centre of the large Tiergarten park.
The next highlight of our tour is also a truly historic place. The Reichstag, the seat of the Deutscher Bundestag (German parliament), has not only had an eventful history since the Reichstag fire in 1933. You can book a guided tour through the dome – the Alte-Fritz adventure tour is especially worthwhile.
To finish off the tour we recommend either a drink at Capital Beach, directly on the riverbank of the Spreebogenpark with a view of the main railway station – or a beer at Zollpackhof on the other side of the Spree. From there you can also comfortably reach Hackescher Markt, where you can spend the evening at any one of the numerous restaurants, cafés and bars.
Begin your second day like royalty, with a stroll around Charlottenburg Palace. Initially constructed as a summer palace, today it is the most splendid palace in Berlin, with extensive gardens. Located directly by the Spree, you’ll feel like you’ve been transported back in time to the rococo period and the days of the Prussian kingdom as you stroll through the park.
 
A short ride from there on the U7 metro will take you directly to Adenauerplatz in the middle of the legendary Kurfürstendamm – the most famous shopping street in Berlin. Here you can peruse the latest designer fashions or simply marvel at the impressive building façades during your walk along the boulevard. The next highlight is waiting for you at the end of the Ku’damm: the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche (Memorial Church) on Breitscheidplatz. The ensemble consists of the ruins of the church destroyed in the war and a new building next to it. It is a monument for peace and reconciliation and a symbol of Berliners’ will to rebuild in the post-war period.
Today the church is encircled by several tall buildings such as the Upper West, the Zoofenster and the Europa Center, the oldest shopping centre in Berlin. You can reach Kaufhaus des Westens at Wittenbergplatz in just a few minutes via the adjacent Tauentzienstraße. KaDeWe is the most famous department store in Germany. Ansbacher Straße and Kurfürstenstraße will take you to Olof-Palme-Platz. And here waiting for you at the end of the tour are two more highlights: Zoologischer Garten and the Aquarium Berlin, that you can gain reduced admission to with the Berlin WelcomeCard.
You can round off the day right next door, at the Monkey Bar in the 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin. The cocktail bar with panoramic windows offers you a breathtaking view over Tiergarten and City West. Alternatively, you can retreat to the Schleusenkrug on warm summer evenings, a cosy beer garden directly on the Landwehr Canal in Tiergarten.
Enjoy an easy-going start on the third day with a late brunch the way the Berliners love them. Things taste even better when there is a view to match. So check out one of the many cafés by the Landwehr Canal or the Neuköllner Schifffahrtskanal (Neukölln Ship Canal). You can then digest your brunch on a walk along the canal. There are unique gems in the way of restaurants, bars and clubs awaiting your visit. Freischwimmer, Club der Visionäre, Badeschiff and IPSE are just four of the locations on the island that form a summertime bar biotope on the left and right of the Flutgraben channel.
Schlesische Straße and Falckensteinstraße then lead you to Oberbaumbrücke, surely the most picturesque bridge in Berlin. From here you have one of the most beautiful views of Berlin in both directions – towards Alexanderplatz with the TV Tower and out of the city with the Molecule Men in the Spree.
 
 
Just around the corner from Oberbaumbrücke you’ll find the East Side Gallery stretching out before you. The longest connected piece of the former Berlin Wall is covered with many different and amazing artworks. The most famous painting is the brotherly kiss between Honecker and Brezhnev. And there are plenty more historic events depicted along the 1.3 km open air gallery.
Over Schillingbrücke, Bethaniendamm and Mariannenplatz you can continue on until Oranienstraße. From Heinrichplatz to Moritzplatz there are so many bars and restaurants that there is certain to be something to suit all tastes. You can review your stay in Berlin over a beer, wine or cocktail. And for those who wish to venture deeper into the night: the legendary SO36, Prince Charles and Ritter Butzke are just three places for an fun-filled club night.

1609,Viktoriapark - Willkommen in Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/viktoriapark,"

  A mountain waterfall, a vineyard and a national memorial – you can find it all in Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg.
  

Kreuzberg is not just the name of the borough in Berlin, but also that of a 66-metre-high hill. On the top of the hill stands a national monument and there is a small, romantic park. Nowhere else in the city can you enjoy the atmosphere of a babbling waterfall.
In the 18th century, Berlin’s highest hill was known as Tempelhofer Berg or sometimes Runder Weinberg (“Round Vineyard”). Not a lot of people know it, but Berlin was once a wine-growing region, and vines really were grown on Tempelhofer Berg right up to the 18th century. The tradition was revived in 1968, and you can acquire a drop of the Kreuz-Neroberger white wine in return for a donation and sample the Berlin tipple for yourself.
In 1818, the foundation stone was laid for the construction of a national memorial in the Neo-Gothic style, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The monument was dedicated in 1821 by King Friedrich Wilhelm III. It symbolised the victorious campaign over Napoleon Bonaparte and the liberation of Europe from French domination. The monument eventually led to the creation of the park 73 years later.
The Riesengebirge – the mountains now known as the Krkonoše on the border between Poland and the Czech Republic – were once the top destination for nobles and wealthy Berliners whenever they had time to spare. The waterfall that can now be admired in Viktoriapark is a replica of a waterfall from those mountains, rendered as accurately as possible using geological studies.
In 1888, Kaiser Friedrich III decided that the monument needed surroundings that befitted it. The park is named in honour of his English wife Victoria. The idea of the waterfall came from Hermann Mächtig, the city’s director of parks and gardens. Made of large rocks, the waterfall is deceptively true to its model in the mountains – the only difference being that the 24-metre-high waterfall is in the middle of the city and powered by a pump.
At the foot of the Kreuzberg, Golgatha is not just for beer drinkers. It has a large beer garden and terrace where you can relax and dance in the evening. Another popular place to go is the Osteria No. 1 on Kreuzbergstraße.
Around the corner at Methfesselstraße 7, a plaque commemorates place were Konrad Zuse designed the Z3, the world’s first programmable computer.
If you carry on along Kreuzbergstraße to the east and cross Mehringdamm, you come to the famous Bergmannstraße and the neighbouring Marheineckeplatz, where you can browse to your heart’s content in all the small shops, take a stroll around and enjoy an excellent coffee and cake at Barcomi’s.

Pandas have finally returned to Germany once again! Since summer 2017 you can visit, you can visit the cute panda couple from China at Berlin Zoo. We have compiled all the important information for you:  
Meng Meng and Jiao Qing have moved into their new home at the zoological garden in Berlin. Animal carers travelled specially from China to ensure the well-being of Meng-Meng and Jiao Qing during the settling-in period. They took care of the new zoo inhabitants together with the Berlin colleagues so that Meng Meng and Jiao Qing feel at home in Berlin in no time at all.
Yet the zoo has not only catered for the pandas: You too can take a break in the newly built visitor plaza and here, in the midst of traditional Chinese architectural elements, modern Asian design and enormous bamboo canes, you will discover everything about China´s cuddly favourite animals - or did you already know that a panda polishes off up to 30 kg of crunchy fresh bamboo every day, has “two” thumbs and used to be a meat eater?

Do you want to get to know Berlin´s sweetest bear couple? Then head for the zoo. Come and meet Berlin´s fluffy bamboo munchers in the Chinese Pavilion. The panda couple are living there in a newly created enclosure with extensive climbing facilities, slides and plenty of green space. You can purchase zoo tickets directly and conveniently online at visitBerlin.de and skip the line at the entrance.

You can find out even more about the new Berliners in the zoo´s panda blog.
Pandas have always had a unique appeal for us - this also applies to Berlin, where panda euphoria has remained strong for decades. The history of pandas in the capital is a long one: It was as early as 1939 when the first living panda was to be seen in Berlin. “Happy” was, however, only passing through and moved onto the USA after two months. Chi-Chi the bear was the next panda to find a temporary home in the Tierpark Berlin. In 1958, Chi-Chi attracted over 400,000 visitors to the Tierpark within a period of three weeks before continuing her journey to London. It was there where she was even to become the model for the world-famous logo of the WWF.
On 5 November 1980, the first panda couple Bao Bao and Tjen Tjen arrived in Berlin as a state gift from the Chinese Premier, Hua Guofeng, to Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Following the death of the lady panda Tjen Tjen - four years later - Bao Bao first lived as a bachelor in the capital. When Yan Yan finally moved into Berlin Zoo in April 1995, the zoo´s visitors were bursting with excitement. But here, again, the pair never brought panda offspring into the world since Yan Yan passed away in 2007.
At the proud age of 34 and thus the oldest living male panda in the world, Bao Bao lived out his years at Berlin Zoo until his death in 2012. Up until summer 2015, the panda couple Bao Bao and Yan Yan could be seen in the special exhibition, “PANDA”, in the Natural History Museum.
With Meng Meng and Jiao Qing, a Germany-wide unique panda couple finally moved into Berlin Zoo.. Having grown up in the breeding station Chengdu in Southwest China, the Chinese government is handing over the pandas to Berlin Zoo as a loan for 15 years. Even potential offspring remain the property of China. After the official opening of the 500 square metre panda enclosure with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and the President of China, Xi Jinping, you will also have the chance to visit Meng Meng and Jiao Qing at Berlin Zoo as of 6 July 2017.
Besides the zoo, there are other places in Berlin where you can discover pandas. For example, the famous Bao Bao can still be seen as a preserved specimen in the Natural History Museum. Pandas also make an appearance in various places as part of Berlin street art in the form of graffiti, such as on the Berlin Wall along the East Side Gallery.

Don''t be afraid of lesbians – that''s the motto of the ironically titled Dyke Fight Party. Women of all stripes meet here, also in the company of male or heterosexual women friends. Started in Kreuzberg, the party''s currently home in the Berlin Club Lovelite in Friedrichshain. Dyke Fight is a typical Berlin party: it doesn''t start before 12:30 and at least a third of the guests are not German. There''s a lot of English spoken.
That''s not really any surprise, given that the party organisers come from all over the world. The always surprising live acts round off the event. The mostly young audience is between 25 and 35 years of age and hits top form sometime between 2 and 3 am. Dyke Fight is on an irregular schedule, but about every 2 months on Saturdays at the Lovelite Club starting at 11 pm.

Tickets
Schloss Köpenick is idyllically situated on an island in the river. Locals call the Baroque building the Wasserschloss (Water Palace) and it is the only Baroque building in Berlin to survive in its original state.
In the 8th century, long before the Hohenzollerns and Kings of Prussia, Slavs built a castle on the island where the palace now stands. The Ascanians conquered the area and the castle after driving out the Slavs in the mid-13th century. The next significant event in the prehistory of the palace happened in 1558, when Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg built a Renaissance-style hunting lodge on the island.
Friedrich – the third son of the Great Elector, Friedrich Wilhelm – was granted the estate in Köpenick to build a palace. The Renaissance castle was completely demolished and replaced with a three-storey Baroque building. Rutger van Langervelt and Johann Arnold Nering were the architects who designed it. Work on the palace continued until 1690. The Italian Giovanni Caroveri embellished the Water Palace with the finest stuccoes to be found north of the Alps. The prince – later crowned King Friedrich I of Prussia – only lived in the palace for a short time together with his wife Elisabeth Henriette. She died young, but it was she who initiated the building on the island of the Margraviate of Brandenburg’s first Protestant palace church, where concerts are now often held.
Once the prince inherited the title of Elector, the palace in Köpenick was only used as a summer residence, and when Friedrich remarried, it lost even that status: Charlottenburg became the new summer residence. However, the location in Köpenick was an attractive one for hunting, which means that the Baroque castle was once again a hunting lodge.
Things heated up at the palace in 1730, when the Prussian court-martial met in its heraldic room. The young crown prince Friedrich – later known as Frederick the Great – was accused of desertion. A traitor to his own land? This was intolerable to his father Friedrich Wilhelm I, who was known as the Soldier King. The crown prince was found guilty and sent to prison in Küstrin.
The branch of Berlin’s Kunstgewerbemuseum that is housed in Schloss Köpenick is a museum of interior design, with ornaments, silverware and furniture in the Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo styles all on show. There are 21 rooms, showing how the bourgeois and the nobility lived in those times. The highlight is the restored heraldic room.

1754,Pergamon Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/pergamon-museum,"
The Pergamonmuseum is nothing short of a wonder in itself. Its rooms are overflowing with some of the world’s most impressive, long buried, treasures. The museum encompasses the vast history of the Ancient East, with collections that can not be experienced elsewhere. The museum is named after the Pergamon Altar, a Hellenistic masterpiece of white stone architecture. The imposing structure invites you to walk the steps of 2000 years of history and behold its intricacies close-up. But don’t get lost in this wonder for too long, as there are many more under the museum’s roof. Artefacts have been gathered from Iran, Asia Minor, Egypt and the Caucasus, and these worlds have been recreated for you to explore within the Pergamonmuseum.
Please note: 
The north wing, including the Pergamon Altar, will be closed for refurbishment until 2023.
After the famous merchant and archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovers what is believed to be the ancient city of Troy, the 19th century sees an explosion of downward exploration, uncovering histories barely imagined until then. German archaeologists and researchers travel to Babylon, Uruk, Ashur and Egypt and send their finds to Berlin. They are cared for and preserved on the Museumsinsel (Museum Island). Over the years, more room is needed for the abundance of discoveries. As a result, a second building is constructed by Alfred Messel between 1910 and 1930. The museum today consists of three wings housing the Antiquity Collection, the Islamic Art Museum, and the Middle East Museum. During the Second World War, the museum suffers some damage, but the artefacts are protected, and the museum survives to be one of the most visited attractions in Berlin. With its monuments such as the 17 metre high Roman Market Gate of Miletus, the Ishtar Gate, and the Mschatta Façade, the museum transports you to an unfamiliar, mystical era. Architecture is key at Pergamonmuseum, filled with shimmering examples of intricately designed facades and gates, 2000 years old and more. In the light flooded halls of the Pergamonmuseum, the intricacy of the Oriental architecture becomes clear. A wonderful example is the Ishtar Gate of Babylon, exquisitely painted in beautiful blues and with reliefs of dragons and lions drawing you in from afar.

Museum Island is a masterpiece of architecture in its own right. The Island begins its life in the 1830s with the opening of the Alte Museum. It continues to grow and develop, being dubbed Museumsinsel by the 1870s. It stands now as a monument to discovery and ancient creation.
The five museums of the island are the Pergamon, Bode Museum, Alte Museum, Neues Museum, and the Alte Nationalgalerie — all of which have something unique to offer. The Neues Museum contains a trove of Egyptian artefacts, the highlight of which is the renowned bust of Nefertiti, famous queen of Egypt. You can walk around in a reconstructed Egyptian courtyard, with everything you could wish for from Ancient Egypt, including mummies. The Alte Nationalgalerie is likened to a temple, modelled on the Acropolis of Athens. Within are works of art in the Classicist, Romantic, Biedermeier, Impressionist, and early modern styles. Painters like Caspar David Friedrich, Manet and Cézanne are represented here. The Bode Museum is a distinctive, copper-domed building, home to the Museum of Byzantine Art and the Münzkabinett. Also on Museumsinsel, you can visit the Berlin Cathedral, the largest church in Berlin, and on the historical boulevard; Unter den Linden. Here you will find the German Historical Museum, dedicated to the history of Germany and its people.
Museum Island is easily accessible by all forms of public transport in Berlin. It can be reached on foot from Friedrichstrasse U- and S-Bahn station. You can also take the underground, using the U6 or S-Bahn lines S1, S2, S25, S5, S7 or S75. The S-Bahn stop of Hackescher Markt is just 15 minutes walk away from the Island. The M1 and 12 trams stop at nearby Kupfergraben, less than 5 minutes walk away. The Lustgarten bus stop is 600m away from Pergamonmuseum and can be reached on buses 100 and 200. You can use the Berlin Welcome Card Museum Island to explore all the museums on Museum Island over three consecutive days. With a Museum Pass Berlin you can visit 50 other museums in Berlin for free. Entry for children and young people up to the age of 18 is generally free. The museum is open on Mondays, and Thursdays offer longer opening hours.
Please note that the north wing, including the Pergamon Altar, will be closed for refurbishment until 2023.

The Reichstag is an internationally recognisable symbol of democracy and the current home of the German parliament. Every year, thousands of guests visit the Reichstag - and with good reason: It is not often that you can enjoy such an amazing panorama while, just beneath your feet, the political decisions of tomorrow are being made. Both as an architectural wonder and a historical testimony, the Reichstag has an important role to play in Berlin.
The original building is designed by Paul Wallot and modelled after the Memorial Hall in Philadelphia. Decorative motifs, sculptures and mosaics are contributed by the artist Otto Lessing. The Reichstag is completed in 1894 although it doesn’t acquire its iconic dedication to “the German People” until 1916 when the words Dem Deutschen Volke are inscribed on its façade. At the time Kaiser Wilhelm II regards the building as “the pinnacle of bad taste”.
The Reichstag serves as the home of the German parliament until 1933 when the building is badly damaged in a fire. This event marks the end of the Weimar Republic and provides a convenient pretext for Hitler to suppress dissent. Under Nazi dictatorship, the building falls into neglect and is severely damaged during the Second World War. In 1945 it becomes one of the primary targets for the Red Army due to its perceived propaganda value.
After the war, West Germany’s parliament is relocated to Bonn, and the building remains a virtual ruin until 1961 when a partial renovation is undertaken in the shadow of the newly erected Wall. Completed in 1964 this controversial restoration sees the building’s interior and exterior stripped of the majority of its statuary. However, the city makes efforts to retain the traces of its more recent history such as the bullet ridden façade and the graffiti left by the occupying Soviet soldiers.
Throughout the cold war period and until the German reunification in 1989 the Reichstag is the site of a permanent exhibition, “Questions about German History” but otherwise sees only occasional ceremonial use. In 1990 the Reichstag is the site of the official reunification ceremony. After another year of intense debate, it is decided that it will once again be the home of the German national parliament. In 1995, just prior to the commencement of Norman Foster’s restoration of the building, artist Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude wrap the Reichstag in fabric. Foster’s careful restoration and redesign of the building is completed in 1999, and the new German government convenes at the Reichstag for the first time on April the 19th.
There is a certain irony in the fact that the building’s glass cupola is not featured in Foster’s original plans for the renovation of the Reichstag. The dome sits directly above the debating chamber. A mirrored cone at its centre directs light into the Reichstag, increasing the building’s energy efficiency and affording visitors a view of the parliamentary proceedings below. The dome itself can be visited by prior registration and is reached by two large steel ramps that curve up towards it in the form of a double helix.

There are a number of important Berlin landmarks situated in the immediate vicinity of the Reichstag. The main railway station, the Bundeskanzleramt and the Brandenburger Tor are all located a short walk away from the parliament building. You can also find a number of memorials nearby. These include the astounding Holocaust-Memorial by Peter Eisenman that consists of 2,711 concrete slabs arranged in a grid in which you can suddenly feel very disoriented and small. Another nearby memorial consisting of a circular pool commemorates the Sinti and Roma victims of National Socialism, whilst a concrete cube containing a video memorialises the homosexuals persecuted under Nazism.
The Reichstag is easily accessible by public transport as it is situated just a short distance from Berlin’s main rail station, the Hauptbahnhof. The number 100 bus, which provides an unrivalled sightseeing opportunity along its route between the Zoo Station in the West and Alexanderplatz in the East, also stops at the Reichstag, as does the M41. The nearest U-Bahn station to the Reichstag is the Bundestag. It is the middle station of only three stations on what is surely Berlin’s shortest U-Bahn line which runs between the Hauptbahnhof and Brandenburger Tor.

1758,Zitadelle Spandau – Spandau Citadel - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/zitadelle-spandau-spandau-citadel,"

  Berlin’s Spandau Citadel, the impressive Zitadelle Renaissance fortress, has a chequered history – from military fortress to cultural and concert venue.
  
Tickets
Spandau Citadel, the Zitadelle Renaissance fortress, is just ten minutes’ walk from Spandau’s old town. Today, the old sixteenth-century Citadel hosts a wealth of cultural events – from medieval festivals and banquets, to concerts, plays and performances.
As you enter the impressive fortress, it’s easy to imagine the sounds of the past – the neighing of horses and shouts of the medieval knights. In these walls, the Renaissance era truly comes alive! The Citadel was constructed in the sixteenth century to protect the city of Berlin. As a defensive fortress, it was designed symmetrically with four bastions connected by four walls of equal length, leaving no blind spots for attackers to hide. The four bastions are called Queen (Königin), King (König), Crown Prince (Kronprinz) and Brandenburg.
The site originally held a thirteenth-century castle. Since the surviving Julius Turm tower was part of that complex, it is now Berlin’s oldest building – and at 34.6 metres high, it is still Spandau’s signature sight. The Julius Turm is open to the public, and the top level offers truly stunning views across Spandau and the River Havel.
The Spandau Citadel is one of the best preserved Renaissance fortresses in all of Europe – and strolling across the grounds inside, history seems to come alive!
Yesterday’s military fortress has become today’s cultural centre – with exhibitions, festivals, concerts, puppet theatre, the popular bat cellar and exhibition, as well as medieval and jousting festivals.
The Spandau Citadel was first opened to the public in 1989. Since then it has hosted a wide range of events – from theatre to international pop music.

Even if the Citadel fortress is only just over a mere four hundred years old – the fortress site has many stories to tell from the last 1000 years. A Slavic settlement excavated by archaeologists dates from around 1050, the oldest traces of human life here.
To find out more about the site, you can visit the Citadel’s varied exhibitions. The west curtain wall shows the remains of a Slavic wall and the later stone castle, while the Commander’s House focuses specifically on the history of the fortress. The Archeological Window offers an insight into the middle ages, and showcases medieval Jewish gravestones thought to have been taken from the Jewish cemetery as building materials. The new setting for the display from late 2015 now allows visitors a closer view of the exhibits.
The regular tours on offer provide a fascinating introduction to the fortress and site. On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays from March to October, there are three tours a day to choose from (in German). Some tours are offered in English and other languages, and a multilingual audio guide is always available.
But the Citadel is not only about history – it is also a magnet for bat experts and fans! Every year, the fortress provides a winter home to around ten thousand bats. Not surprisingly, one absolute visitor highlight – especially for children – is the vaulted bat cellar, where you can see around 200 flying fox bats. The cellar exhibition is also dedicated to these winter guests. The cellar is open every day, and you can register in advance for one of the popular guided ‘bat tours’ through the vaulted corridors.
Every year in summer, the Citadel hosts major national and international names at the Citadel Music Festival, which regularly attracts up to 10,000 fans. Against the backdrop of the illuminated fortress complex, the festival has a very special atmosphere – and this unusual setting only adds to the thrills of the music.
During the festival, the Citadel also holds a lively night market with artisan stalls offer a wide range of goods and bargains.
Every year, the Spandau Citadel holds a children’s festival with an array of magical events, especially for its youngest visitors! It also regularly hosts puppet theatre shows for children aged three and over. In addition, the fortress offers children’s workshops and many children’s tours along the corridors in the thick fortress walls.

1798,Dicke Marie - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/dicke-marie,"

  In Tegel Forest there is a huge oak tree called Dicke Marie. It’s the oldest tree in Berlin and is even older than the city itself. 
  

Dicke Marie – fat Mary – was once the nickname of a cook, but today, it’s the name of Berlin’s oldest living resident. Nobody knows exactly how old Dicke Marie is – and no-one can ask her either. She is thought to be between 800 and 900 years old. If you still haven’t guessed: Dicke Marie is the oldest tree in the Berlin – older than the city itself.
In 1237 Dicke Marie was already watching as the mediaeval town grew up nearby. Later she saw robber barons and kings riding through the woods by Lake Tegel where she lived then and still does today. Many trees have grown up around her to keep her company. The famous poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is said to have paid her a visit when passing through. It was only later that the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) was given the name “Dicke Marie” by two young boys.
Those two boys were none other than Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt, who grew up in the palace known as Schloss Tegel, where their tutors taught them statistics, economics, natural law and philosophy. To amuse themselves, they would sometimes wander through the woods, always looking for new adventures. Once, they came across the huge oak tree. legend has it that the boys were amazed by the tree and it reminded them of their cook. From then on, they called it “Dicke Marie” after their sturdily built cook.
From the harbour bridge in Tegel it’s only a few minutes’ walk to Dicke Marie, who is waiting for you in Tegel Forest. When you visit the castle or take a steamer trip, it’s well worth taking time to see the famous oak. The 26-metre-tall tree has an aura of calm and wisdom. If you want to enjoy the countryside even more, you can also visit the nearby Humboldt Oak.

  From Octopussy to The Spy Who Can In From The Cold: the history of espionage in Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie.
  

Checkpoint Charlie was the setting for many thrillers and spy novels, from James Bond in Octopussy to The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.
Located on the corner of Friedrichstraße and Zimmerstraße, it is a reminder of the former border crossing, the Cold War and the partition of Berlin. The barrier and checkpoint booth, the flag and the sandbags are all based on the original site – and are a popular subject for photos. It’s no wonder that Checkpoint Charlie is one of the sights of Berlin that you really should see.
The name Checkpoint Charlie comes from the NATO phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie). After the border crossings at Helmstedt-Marienborn (Alpha) and Dreilinden-Drewitz (Bravo), Checkpoint Charlie was the third checkpoint opened by the Allies in and around Berlin.
It became the most famous crossing point between East and West Germany. On 22 September 1961, Allied guards began registering members of the American, British and French forces before trips to East Berlin and foreign tourists could find out about their stay there. Once the checkpoint was designated a crossing point for members of the Allied armed forces, a month later in October 1961 it became the scene of a tank confrontation. American and Soviet tanks took up position and faced each other with weapons primed.
Checkpoint Charlie was not only an important Cold War site, but also witnessed numerous attempts to escape from East Berlin. An open air exhibition on the corner of Schützenstraße and Zimmerstraße tells the story of those that failed and those that succeeded. An installation by the artist Frank Thiel and a commemorative plate also mark the memorial.

1816,Schloss Bellevue - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/schloss-bellevue,"

  From Theodor Heuss to Frank-Walter Steinmeier – all of them have resided here while in office, because Schloss Bellevue is the seat of the Germany’s president. 
  

Art historians have long argued about the palace architecture – is it still Baroque or is it already Neoclassical? These days, the architecture of the three-winged, two-storey palace is classed as Early Neoclassical. A compromise, in other words. Clear lines without much embellishment – the typical features of a seat of power, but still the building is rather uncharacteristic. But why not make up your own mind?
Schloss Bellevue was commissioned in 1785 by Prince August Ferdinand of Prussia. The white building in the northern part of the Tiergarten was completed two years later. At that time, there was only one side wing along with the main building. The property was used by Frederick the Great’s youngest brother as a residence and was not intended for show. It was characterised by its simplicity, but stood out with one of the finest landscape gardens of the time. The guest list featured many famous personalities: the German poet and dramatist Friedrich von Schiller and the French ruler Napoleon Bonaparte both visited the prince at his residential palace.  
Several decades and Prussian kings later, the palace was converted to an art museum known as the Vaterländische Galerie. From 1844, contemporary Prussian works were exhibited in the rooms on the ground floor. King Friedrich-Wilhelm IV allowed the public access to the palace gardens. After 21 years, the artworks moved out again and the palace was used by the Prussian imperial court, housing royal gardeners, maids, cooks, grooms, valets, gamekeepers and saddlers.
The palace survived the first world war unscathed and passed into the possession of the Weimar government. It was used to house state visitors and thus, for the first time, as a representative building. It was less fortunate during the second world war – apart from a few exterior walls, the whole palace was reduced to ruins.
The palace in the Tiergarten was rebuilt from 1955 to 1959. During this time, the German parliament declared it the second seat of office and residence of the President, who until then had only resided at the Villa Hammerschmidt in Bonn. In a slightly late response to Germany''s reunification, the Bundespräsident moved to the capital permanently in 1994.
Richard von Weizsäcker “swapped” the order of the president’s seats of office and residence. Since then, Schloss Bellevue in Berlin has been the president’s primary home, and the “White House of Bonn” has been relegated to second place. As big and beautiful as the palace may be, most presidents prefer not to move privately into Bellevue with its view of the Spree. The palace is used for New Year’s receptions, and for state and inaugural visits. Once a year there is an open day, when the general public are invited to visit, and for just one day feel like princes and princesses, kings and queens, or presidents.
The ancient– the flag that flies outside Schloss Bellevue – is taken down when the president is at his residence in Bonn, on a trip abroad or visiting another Bundesland.

1844,Altstadt Spandau | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/altstadt-spandau,"

  Spandau is five years older than Berlin, as long-time residents sometimes like to stress proudly.
  

This is perhaps because, despite all the new buildings, the long history of Spandau can still really be felt in the historic centre. It’s well worth a visit to discover the architecture while strolling through the city.
Coming out of the Altstadt Spandau U-Bahn station, you enter the historic city centre, which is now a pedestrian zone and shopping area. Although the old buildings have largely been destroyed in wars and fires, the alleys still maintain their medieval layout. Houses in different architectural styles stand side by side and tell the stories of different eras. One sight worth seeing is the Reformationsplatz with the St. Nikolai church, a three-aisled gothic brick church. Nearby is the Gotische Haus (“Gothic House”) (32 Breite Straße), the stone construction of which was rare and expensive for the 15th century. The network of ribbed vaulting, the double arcades of pointed arches, and the classical external façade (which was built later) all still survive. Today, the Gotische Haus is home to a city history museum and temporary exhibitions. A longer section of the remains of the city wall from the 14th survives on Viktoria-Ufer.
Crossing the Am Juliusturm road you get to the “Kolk” on Behnitz island. Studies suggest that the Kolk is the oldest settlement area in Spandau. Picturesque restaurants on the Havel river, narrow alleyways, and the St. Marien am Behnitz church, which now offers cultural events, invite visitors to linger. Kolk 5, a house that was restored in the 70s, displays an extraordinary half-timbered façade. Just one U-Bahn stop away lies the Spandau Citadel, one of the most important Renaissance strongholds in Europe, in which, for example, the Citadel Music Festival takes place.

1847,Gemäldegalerie (Old Master Paintings) | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/gemaldegalerie-old-master-paintings,"
The greatest European painters are represented in Berlin''s Gemäldegalerie. This gallery within the Kulturforum (Culture Forum) displays priceless paintings from the Middle Ages and the early modernist period: works by Rubens, Biblical motifs by Botticelli or astonishingly vibrant portraits by Albrecht Dürer.
The Gemäldegalerie opens in 1830. From the outset, visitors can see masterpieces here, including works by great artists such as Rembrandt and Botticelli. The collection loses many of its pieces to fire and misplacement during World War II, and with the division of Berlin, the Gemäldegalerie collection is also separated. Today, it''s been reunited in the new museum building at the Kulturforum. The Museum showcases a permanent collection of 1,400 artworks. A tour takes you across more than two kilometres, featuring 18 rooms and 41 cabinets. The gallery has a simple and modern design, and every room has a different coloured wall, providing the perfect background for the paintings. All rooms lead to the central foyer, which features a water installation by Walter De Maria. This central space is perfect for a short meditative rest.
Take a look at the ceilings in each room: you will notice that all the paintings are lit only by daylight, so the artworks almost appear to radiate their own light. One of these works is ''Amor Vincit Omnia'' by Caravaggio; the winged boy is typical of the style of this master. Or ''Madonna in the Church'' by Jan van Eyck: the Madonna, clothed in a crown and fine dress, bears the baby Jesus in a Gothic church. The painting with two monkeys is also famous. They sit chained, looking down upon a 16th-century port. The painting''s creator was Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and it is entitled ''Two Chained Monkeys''. Even today, art critics are undecided over its meaning. Take time to see the famous paintings by Sandro Botticelli. Many of the women in his paintings are reminiscent of one of his most famous works, the ''Birth of Venus''. The same applies to the image ''Madonna with Child'', and ''The Virgin and Child Enthroned''. Thomas Gainsborough captures the vitality of children in his portrait of the four Marsham siblings in ''The Marsham Children''. Try to decipher Bruegel''s ''The Netherlandish Proverbs'' - around 100 sayings are depicted in the painting. In the Gemäldegalerie, you also have the unique opportunity to see a work by Georges de La Tour. ''Peasant Couple Eating'' is the only one of his works to hang in a German museum. One of the most famous paintings in the collection is ''The Man with the Golden Helmet''. Long considered one of Rembrandt''s masterpieces, scholars now believe that it is in fact the work of another painter from his circle.
Amongst the sand-coloured buildings of the Kulturforum, you will find the Kupferstichkabinett (Museum of Prints and Drawings), Germany''s largest collection of graphic art. View over 500,000 prints and 110,000 drawings, sketches and pictures, including medieval book illustrations. In the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Decorative Arts) next door, there''s gold and silverware, filigree-embroidered clothes and industrial design furniture. Only a short walk from the Kulturforum, you can see abstract geometrical works at the Daimler Art Collection at Potsdamer Platz. The Haus am Lützowplatz shows contemporary art behind its baroque façade. On the other side of the River Spree, the Bahaus Archive displays the world''s most comprehensive collection of works and documents from the Bauhaus Movement.
You have plenty of time to see the gallery on Thursdays, when the museum is open until 20:00. Take the tour ''Art in the Evening'', which has various thematic focuses, while groups can join the 60 minute ''Best of the Gallery'' tour, which provides a good overview. With a Berlin Museum Pass, you can visit the museum for free on three consecutive days. Children and young people under 18 generally enter free of charge to all State Museums. Please register in advance for large group visits. For children, there are additional guided tours. The Gemäldegalerie is just 700m from Potsdamer Platz. You can reach it by public transport. The underground line U2 stops here, as do S-Bahn lines S1, S2 and S25. The buses M48 and M85 will take you directly to the Kulturforum. If you are travelling by car, there are car parks at the Sony Centre and Potsdamer Platz Arkaden.

1934,Memorial to the German Resistance | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/memorial-german-resistance,"

  Courageous people gave their lives to bring down the Nazi dictatorship. The Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand commemorates them.
  

On the morning of 20 July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg flew to a meeting at the Wolf’s Lair, Hitler’s military headquarters in East Prussia. In his briefcase, he had a bomb to kill Hitler and bring down the Nazi regime. The attempt failed. The very same night, shortly after midnight, Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators were executed in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock in Berlin.
At this place today, the Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand commemorates not only Stauffenberg, but also all the other courageous people and groups who resisted the Nazis. Since 1953, the courtyard has been a place of remembrance. The exhibition and educational centre were opened in 1968.
The Bendlerblock is a building complex that was constructed from 1911 to 1914 for the imperial German navy. After the First World War, the newly established ministry of defence also moved into the buildings. Under the Nazis, several departments of the naval high command and the foreign and defence office were housed in the Bendlerblock. Also based here was the supreme high command of the German army, where General Friedrich Olbricht plotted a coup against Hitler.
Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg had been a staff officer at Olbricht’s office since 1943 and attended military briefings at the Wolf’s Lair, Hitler’s military headquarters in East Prussia. On 20 July 1944 he carried out an assassination attempt there, but Hitler survived the explosion and the coup failed. That very same night, Stauffenberg, along with Olbricht and fellow resistance members Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim and Werner von Haeften were executed in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock, which is now a memorial to them.
On 20 July 1952 the foundation stone was laid for a memorial in the courtyard. A year later, the mayor of Berlin, Ernst Reuter, unveiled the memorial. On 20 July 1968, an educational and memorial centre opened, with a permanent exhibition on the military resistance to the Nazis. In the late 1980s, at the initiative of the then mayor, Richard von Weizsäcker, the memorial centre was extended to commemorate not only Stauffenberg’s plot, but all those in Germany who resisted national socialism.
The exhibition was updated in 2014, and now includes 1000 photographs and documents showing the resistance among the labour movement, the church, artists and intellectuals, Jews, Sinti and Roma, as well as the ‘silent helpers’ who came to the aid of Jews and refugees in hiding. The exhibition shows how these peoples’ resistance developed, what motivated them and how they formed networks. Other episodes include Georg Elser’s assassination attempt in November 1939, the Kreisau Circle, the White Rose and the Red Orchestra. You can not only find out about the resistance of these people and groups, but also the Nazi dictatorship’s ruthless response to the actions of the resistance.
Guided tours take place every Sunday at 3pm.

1935,The Story of Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/story-berlin,"
A visit to The Story of Berlin gives you the opportunity to learn about the history of the city. The multimedia displays, spread over 23 different rooms, walk the visitor through 800 years of Berlin history, from the earliest mentions of the city in the 13th century through to German reunification in the 1990s. The interactive nature of The Story of Berlin makes it an ideal attraction for families with children. The museum exhibits show everyday life of Berliners through different historical eras, starting at the entrance hall which is the recreation of a tenement housing building from the city''s past. Museum exhibits have been collated by historians, artists and history education specialists, and mainly focus on the momentous events of the 20th century. Learn first-hand about how ordinary Berlin citizens live through two World Wars, and see the differences between life in the East and West during the communist era. End your visit with a guided tour of Berlin''s largest nuclear bunker. Built in the 1970s, it offers protection for 3,600 people in the event of a nuclear missile attack, a function which the bunker would still have to undertake today.
The Story of Berlin opens in June 1999 in the Ku''damm Karree mall with the purpose of exhibiting the everyday lives of Berlin residents through the ages. This is done by using modern technology in displays, and recreations of everyday scenes. It gives visitors the chance to experience history rather than just read about it. Go through a time tunnel to differently themed rooms that are not just about the past, they explore current issues too. For example, the space about Faith and Tolerance is all about how different cultures have lived together in Berlin through the centuries. The original nuclear bunker, which forms part of the display, is located deep under Kurfürstendamm.
Just a few minutes'' walk from The Story of Berlin is the Käthe Kollwitz museum, located on Fasanenstraße. Here you can learn all about one of Germany''s most famous 20th-century artists in over four floors of exhibits. Next door to the Kollwitz museum is Literaturhaus Berlin, featuring frequently changing exhibitions from the contemporary literature scene, along with author readings. 20 minutes'' walk or two underground stations away is the Gas Lantern Museum. At the Tiergarten S-Bahn station, you will find an open-air museum featuring the largest collection of gas lanterns in Europe. Open both during the day and at night, it is best to visit the Lantern Museum in the dark so you can experience the gas lanterns as they would have been seen in the past. Also close by is KPM, the royal porcelain factory museum, where you can learn about the history of porcelain making or take a factory tour. Explore the area around Hansaplatz to see how Berlin''s architecture develops during the 1950s, with modernist buildings by the likes of Oscar Niemeyer and Walter Gropius. Finally, consider a visit to one of the many art exhibitions hosted by the Academy of Arts where events often focus on social policy issues. The building often hosts concerts, lectures or talks by well-known artists.
The Story of Berlin is in the west of the city on the famous Kurfürstendamm. The best way of getting to the museum is to take the U1 underground line and get off at the Uhlandstraße stop. Alternatively, you can take the S5, S7 or S75 S-Bahn lines and get off at Savignyplatz station. If you are a Berlin WelcomeCard holder, you will get 25% off the adult entrance price. Admission to the nuclear bunker is included in the ticket price, and guided tours run on the hour with increased frequency during the high season of March to October. Expect to spend around two hours in the museum and the bunker. Download the museum app onto your smartphone to help guide you through the themed rooms; the museum staff will give you the code to unlock the app when you arrive. The museum is happy to accommodate general group tours or themed tours when booked in advance.

1938,Stasi Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/stasi-museum,"
In Normannenstraße, to the east of Berlin city centre, you''ll find the Stasi Museum, formerly home of the Ministry of State Security. In this building you can discover how the Stasi operates and take a look at their original technology such as bugs, hidden cameras and weapons. The main attraction is the office of Erich Mielke, Minister of State Security and head of the Stasi from 1957 to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The second floor of the building remains untouched since the days of the Stasi, complete with desks, chairs and filing cabinets.
The complex of buildings at Normannenstraße is the original financial office for the surrounding district, and it is not until 1961 that the Ministry of National Security is established in the building. Building Number 1 is then occupied by Erich Mielke for almost three decades. During the 1970s, the size of the Stasi operation expands greatly and occupies the whole site, even taking over an Apostolic Church building. This building complex becomes the control centre for surveillance throughout East Germany and an embodiment of state power. The ministry remains until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and on 15th January 1990 the building is occupied by demonstrators. There is a growing popular demand to disband the Stasi''s operations and make their files public, and the process moves quickly.
By November 1990 a volunteer group mount the first public exhibition in the building, allowing ordinary East Germans in for the first time in decades - something unthinkable only a few months before. Today''s visitors can see the permanent exhibition on State Surveillance during the GDR era and see the highly secretive methods used for spying on citizens. One of the stand-out exhibits is Mielke''s red briefcase, in which he keeps the most sensitive information, including files on his own boss Erich Honecker. The museum also explains how informants are recruited, how the population is controlled, and ordinary people share how surveillance impacts their lives. At the heart of the museum on the second floor are the Ministerial offices, where even the curtains and telephones are untouched from the days when they were occupied by Mielke and his colleagues. The only things removed from the museum are the Stasi files, so numerous that the indexing and cataloguing process is still ongoing.

Normannenstraße is also home to exhibitions on revolution and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and include period TV recordings, news reels, documents and other media from the point of view of those who experienced it. Another interesting building is the archives of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi documents, around 20 minutes on the underground from the Stasi Museum. Guided tours around the archives are available in English for groups booked in advance. You can also visit the site of the former men''s prison at Rummelsburg, which tells stories from 21 different prisoners through Berlin''s history, including the GDR. Another interesting site is the former political prison at Hohenschönhausen, where the cells and interview rooms are preserved to give insight into the methods used by the regime. Tours are guided by former prisoners who tell you about their experiences. It will take about 30 minutes by tram or bus to get to the museum. Something a little different, but still relevant to life in the East German regime is the Computerspielemuseum (Museum of Computer Games), only 15 minutes on the U5 underground line from the Stasi Museum. This unusual museum has 300 exhibits covering the history of gaming from the earliest personal computers to the latest games consoles. Their prized exhibit is the only slot gambling machine allowed in the GDR, known as Poly-Play.
The easiest way of getting to the Stasi Museum is on the U-Bahn (underground). Take the U5 line to Magdalenenstraße, and the museum is another 10 minutes'' walk from there. Alternatively, take the overground S-Bahn to Frankfurter Allee. For drivers, the parking spaces belonging to the museum are easily accessible. If you are visiting as a group, pre-book a guided tour by email. If you have a Berlin WelcomeCard, you will get 25% off the entry fee and 33% off a student ticket. Please note that the museum only accepts cash. The museum is open every day, including weekends and public holidays.

1946,Anti-War-Museum - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/anti-war-museum,"
Speaking out against violence and war, the Anti-War Museum is established in Berlin at the beginning of the 1920s. The National Socialists close the establishment in 1933. A second attempt to revive the project fails during the war, with the Anti-War Museum (then in Brussels) burned down during the German Western campaign. Almost 40 years later, the Anti-War Museum is re-established. This time it remains: as a plea against war, revealing to you old air-raid shelters, war toys, meaningful photos and documents. It reveals war''s tragic history.
The idea for an anti-war museum in Berlin came from Ernst Friedrich, from Wrocław. In 1925, he founds it at Alexanderplatz in Berlin. Tragically, the National Socialists close it and arrest Friedrich for a time. A place that stands against violence, suffers violence. The SA turn it into a torture chamber, a so-called '"storm restaurant.'" Friedrich''s grandson Tommy Spree re-opens the Anti-War Museum in Berlin in 1982. It is a small museum in a classic Berlin building, typical of the former working-class district, Wedding. Many exhibits are deliberately oppressive: soldiers'' helmets, warfare agents and gas masks fill the display cabinets. The air-raid shelter looks realistic, with a rusty bed frame made during war days. Inscriptions on a historic bunk door from the borough of Neukölln testify to the hours that people spent here during the bomb attacks. To keep calm, a woman writes on the metal the date and time of almost every air-raid alarm. The Second World War is not the only focus – the Anti-War Museum displays photographs of casualties from the First World War, to emphasise the horror. A world map indicates all current war zones. The art displayed in the Anti-War Museum is also a protest against violence: photographs, writings and paintings are characterized by their abstract as well as direct appeals for pacifism. Artists include Karl Kraus, Evelyn Sion and Kurt Tucholsky.
Resistance fighters and victims of the Second World War are commemorated on a memorial stone in the Dorotheenstadt Cemetery. The plain and simple monument includes the names of several notable figures. Another memorial site stands today at the former Plötzensee prison: the National Socialist regime formerly locks up and executes its political opponents here. The site reminds us, for example, of those involved in the Hitler assassination attempt of July 20, 1944. Murellenberg commemorates the victims of the NS-Justiz. In 1945, more than 200 soldiers are killed, accused of desertion. 106 traffic mirrors serve as memorial markers, some bearing inscriptions by the artist Patricia Pisani. The German-Russian Museum, on the other hand, can be found in the place where German military power capitulates on May 8, 1945. The gallery CHAUSSEE 36 is situated in a former Prussian officer''s house and exhibits photography. There is also a restored air-raid shelter.

Take an exciting discovery tour beneath the streets of the metropolis with a visit to the Berliner Unterwelten-Museum. Learn more about the secret history of the city. Descend into abandoned Metro stations, bunkers, as well as tunnel and channel systems. The headquarters of the Underworlds Association is located in a former bunker in the transport hub of Gesundbrunnen. Learn all about the capital''s many underground facilities in the four-floor exhibition.
Berlin''s surface is just the visible part of the city: among the large squares and streets, relics, tunnels and secret passages from Berlin''s changing history slumber. Particularly impressive are the ruins of bunkers. Since 1997, the Berlin non-profit Underworlds Association has managed these fateful buildings. 1999 is the first time that visitors are taken on guided tours through the extensive bunker complex in Gesundbrunnen U-Bahnhof. The Association is formed to explore, document and preserve Berlin''s underground infrastructure and make it available to the public. Throughout the year, Unterwelten-Museum gives seminars, workshops and numerous tours and exhibitions offering vivid insights into the work up close. Various guided tours focus on the civilian air raid during the Second World War. On tours through the underground, you also encounter special historic features such as the pneumatic tube system, East Germany escape tunnels, ammunition findings and archaeological treasures. The Berliner Unterwelten guides reveal exciting and moving insights. Learn about how Berlin was built on sand and how it came to be what it is today, as you discover the impressive historic waterworks on the Müggelsee. Also recommended is a descent into the basement of the BerlinerKindl brewery in Berlin-Neukölln. Parts of the plant date from the establishment of this privately-owned brewery in 2009. After the tour, you can sample the house beers. The extraordinary exhibition of Germania examines the Nazis'' plans for the intended imperial capital of Berlin.
The Labyrinth Children''s Museum is located on Oslo Road, just a 15-minute walk from the Berliner Unterwelten Museum.

The Museum of Natural History has a long history of its own. In 1889, Kaiser Wilhelm II opens the building on Invalidenstraße. With its powerful pillars and large stature, the Wilhelmian building looks like a palace. Upon entering the central villagers'' yard, you are welcomed by a dinosaur who leads you on a tour of the dinosaur museum. Engage with interactive exhibits about the former rulers of our planet. Futuristic virtual reality exhibits reawaken these formidable animals, bringing them to life before your eyes. But be sure to explore the other exhibition halls which each focus on a different theme. Particularly rewarding are the so-called ''wet collections''. These are housed in the East Wing, a state-of-the-art building that has been restored in 2010. A total of 276,000 glass jars filled with 81,880 litres of alcohol line 12.6 km of shelves in this dramatic space. Fish, spiders, crabs, amphibians and mammals are conserved here. Gaze at the fascinating and curious objects behind the glass. In the exhibition '"Highlights of the Art of Preservation'", you can get up close with animals such as Bobby the gorilla and Knut the polar bear. Thanks to the latest techniques and the artistic abilities of the preservationists, the objects seem to be alive still.

1957,Trabi Museum Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/trabi-museum-berlin,"
The Trabi has long been a favourite with race car enthusiasts, both past and present. Rattling engines and the historically long waiting list to get one prove the cult car from the East Germany isn''t perfect, but still hugely popular. Production of the Trabant ceased in 1991, but former owners can still feel nostalgic about their old cars. The Trabant has become a cult car, and now the museum in Berlin attracts visitors from all over the world. A visit to the Trabant museum will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about the car, and you can even take a Trabant safari through the city. The museum at Checkpoint Charlie has classic Trabants such as the 601, alongside rarer rally cars.
The cult of the Trabant has been going strong for more than 25 years. In 2013, a museum dedicated to this iconic car opens at Checkpoint Charlie on the ground floor of a huge 19th century building, with the aim of preserving the history of East German car making. In 1958 the first model rolls off the production line, somewhat reminiscent of the VW Beetle. Trabants are displayed in chronological order, including the rare P50 and P60 models. The classic Trabant is the 601, which survives all the way up to the reunification of Germany. All variations and colours of the 601 are on display, including the campervan model. Look out for rare Trabi rally cars, military vehicles, jeeps and police cars. For a while, you''ll be transported back to the GDR. The museum''s oldest vehicle is the DKW, dating from the 1930s. Watch a film about the importance of Trabis in East German culture in the on-site cinema. Finish your visit in the shop, where you can buy souvenirs such as model Trabants. Right next door is TrabiWorld, a car rental place where you can get behind the wheel of a Trabi and hit the Berlin streets.
Just a few steps from the Trabi Museum at Checkpoint Charlie is the Cold War Museum. This tells the story of escape attempts across the border zone between East and West Berlin. Of particular interest is the original items used in escapes - everything from a car boot to a hot air balloon, and even mini-submarines and homemade surfboards. Also nearby is the German Currywurstmuseum, where you can learn everything about the invention of this classic German snack in the post-war era. The museum is highly interactive, and of course there''s a chance to sample the snack itself. Children will also enjoy making sausages with the CurryUp! computer game.
Take the U6 underground line to Kochstraße/Checkpoint Charlie station, emerging by the large portraits of soldiers on Friedrichstraße. Walk to the corner of Zimmerstraße and turn left. 100m along this street brings you to the Trabi museum, which is open daily. Children under 12 get in for free, and groups recieve a discount on request. Berlin WelcomeCard holders receive a 50% discount on the admission price.

1959,C/O Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/co-berlin,"
Pictures say more than a thousand words - this is the motto at C/O Berlin, an innovative, modern and international exhibition space devoted to photography. Up to three alternating group and solo exhibitions run simultaneously, featuring both famous artists and emerging talent. Anton Corbijn, Annie Leibovitz, Sebastião Salgado, Martin Parr, Nan Goldin and Peter Lindbergh are just a few examples. Subjects range from Bill Clinton to Kate Moss, East to West, Leica photography to fashion shots. Even the magnetic designer Karl Lagerfeld has held an exhibition here. With C/O Berlin you can be sure of one thing: exhibitions attract public attention. Come and be inspired by affecting photographs and life-size portraits.
C/O Berlin is a non-profit organisation, founded in 2000 by three passionate photography experts - photographer Stephan Erfurt, designer Marc Naroska and architect Ingo Pott. An important part of their concept is to create a forum for visual education, going beyond the exhibition of photography to discuss, explain and disseminate it. Since 2006, they have supported young photographers and art critics with their annual international talent competition. C/O Berlin is now located at America House, the culture and information centre for America during the Interbau building exhibition in the late 1950s. Its rooms are flooded with light, thanks to its large windows. Notice that the structure of the original building is only partially visible, a quirk that creates a fittingly rough charm. The exhibition rooms are mostly kept in the minimalist style of the 1950s. The focus is instead on the photographs themselves: artistic renderings of film stars, supermodels and politicians. Besides evocative portraits, you''ll find snapshots of political events, some of social significance, some entertaining. Unique motifs and creative compositions grab your attention. But the exhibitions are not the whole picture. A thrilling array of lectures, panel discussions and artists'' seminars let you delve deeper into the detail. You can also meet other photographers at the café in C/O Berlin, which is purposefully designed to promote collaboration.

1960,Berlin Energy Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-energy-museum,"
Annual energy consumption in Germany is now over 7140kWh per capita. But what is the real power behind all this? What is necessary to get electricity from the power station to the end user without interference? How did things look 100 years ago, and to what extent is the Berlin '"electropolis'" pioneering the development of technology? The permanent exhibition of the Berlin Energy Museum is an exciting introduction into these questions. Located in a former battery storage facility in Steglitz, the museum has over 5,000 exhibits from all aspects of power generation. Interacting is allowed and actively encouraged.
Founded in 2001 by previous employees of the former Bewag AG (Berliner Städtische Elektrizitätswerke), from 1911 to 1994 the site of the museum is a power station operated by Bewag. In the open air, you now meet the first exhibition about network technology: three man-sized transformers stand next to an advertising column. You can see the individual components of station technology and understand their functions. You then enter the halls of the former battery storage system. One topic is power plant engineering. The task of a power plant is to convert primary energy like coal into electrical energy. You can understand this process by means of turbines, pumps and valves. On the model of a combined cycle power plant, you can control the start-up process. In order to protect the power supply from faults such as short circuits, overloads and lightning strikes, additional protection is important. Try out a 10 kV model for the end user''s power supply. You can also simulate an error and take necessary steps to protect the network. The exhibits include clocks, meter technology and devices for current and voltage measurement. In communication technology, experiment with a hand-held system, use a telecommuter and see how a Strowger switch works. Work safety is also a topic, including a large archive of former work regulations, fire extinguishers and medical service equipment. Especially interesting is the exhibition on public lighting, covering the period from the introduction of street lighting back in 1884 to the present day. At the other end of the power grid, 120 years of development history can be viewed, including common household appliances such as heaters, an old sewing machine and a collection of radio equipment.
After seeing the past, look to the future: The Futurium, located on the River Spree, presents science, research and development. From 2017, changing exhibitions will showcase futuristic ideas and innovations. The Industriesalon Schöneweide presents details of industrial culture in its permanent exhibition covering 600 square metres. You can also see many photographs and machines for producing electron tubes.The focus is on television electronics from 1945 onwards.
Take the subway line U9 to Rathaus Steglitz. From there, take the bus 186 or 283 to the Teltowkanalstraße stop. Museum entrance is free and there are no fixed opening times. Please make your reservation by e-mail or phone. For school trips there is special accompanying material, which you can get in advance by e-mail. Feel free to mention your expertise or the subject area you are particularly interested in - the guided tours are then coordinated to suit your interests.

1962,Labyrinth Children's Museum – Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/labyrinth-childrens-museum-berlin,"

  Labyrinth Children''s Museum in Berlin is about interactive learning. Housed in an old industrial building, children can learn about their world through play.
  

In the Berlin Labyrinth Children''s Museum you''ll enter an interactive world of games and exploration stations. Housed in a former factory building, the museum has created a children''s paradise: slides, craft tables and experiment areas - the choice is huge. The museum''s slogan is '"Learning by making and doing'". Every two years the museum''s theme changes to focus on a new aspect of the building or on a different world culture.
The creators of Berlin''s children''s museum firmly believe that the best way to learn is through play. Dating from the 19th century and housed in an old match factory on Osloer Straße, the museum opens the doors to its first exhibition in 1997. The frequently changing themes result in a maze-like experience for children. The aim of the game is touching, joining in and trying your best. Each themed exhibition stays in place for between 16 and 18 months before being replaced, and all are intended for children aged between 3 and 11. The overarching theme of the museum is cultural and professional diversity. For example, in one section, children can read stories in a Mongolian yurt. In another, they can pretend to be an architect or engineer at work. Or they can play shop with the fabric vegetables and wooden items in the international market place. The museum also follows its playful theme with its entry discounts. On '"Dice Day'", roll a six and you''ll get in for free. As well as the ever changing exhibitions, there are also workshops where children can be creative with adult input, by making bookmarks or creating road signs. The association which runs the museum is particularly involved in projects with schools and kindergartens, giving educational professionals and teachers the chance to get involved in designing the museum''s learning activities.
Another children''s museum is MACHmit! in the Prenzlauer Berg area of the city, which allows children to explore the world interactively. MACHmit! is housed in a former church where children can experiment with different learning and play stations. Highlights include a multi-level climbing frame, an old-fashioned soap shop and a room of mirrors. In Wuhlheide Park, the FEZ centre is one of Europe''s largest leisure complexes. There is the Alice-Museum with interactive exhibits, the Astrid-Lindgren-Theatre and Eco-Island, with mini rainforest and eco-garden. FEZ also features a very large swimming area.
Take the M13 tram line to either Grüntaler Straße or the corner of Osloer Straße and Prinzenallee. From here, it''s only 200 metres to the old factory which houses the Labyrinth Children''s Museum. Alternatively, take the M27 line to the last stop. Opening times are seasonal and vary during school holidays. Free admission for Museumspass holders. Children take their shoes off at the museum so they will need slippers or socks.
Every Friday the museum hosts a family buffet. Discounts are available for group and family travel cards, prices are lower in school holidays, and there is an increased programme of craft classes and workshops. Groups and schools receive special discounts too. The Labyrinth Children''s Museum can host children''s birthday parties and runs workshops for children and their parents.

Since 1997 Berlin has had its own underground museum, one of three in Europe alongside Moscow and Budapest. The transport museum is housed in one of the former historic control rooms at the Olympia Stadium metro station. Between 1931 and 1983, 616 railway lines, 99 signals and 103 switches are controlled from here. Today, find out about the history of the Berlin underground. Be amazed at the impressive exhibits and many pieces of working machinery. You can easily take a trip on a historic train at certain points throughout the year.
By 1931, the railway switches at the Olympic Stadium are the largest in Europe. By 1983, a new track layout threatens the station''s survival, but an employee protest prevents demolition. In 1997, the Berlin Underground Working Group opens the exhibition, showcasing 100 years of Berlin underground history in the interconnected rooms under the station. Many of the exhibits come from the collection of previous manager Klaus Siepert. Enter the museum between underground trains, and get your tickets from an authentic ticket machine. Look at the large wooden notice board featuring underground network plans from 1936, air raid protection measures from World War II and different messages from the police and BVG (the Berlin Transport Company).
Several exhibits also remind visitors of the division of Berlin after the war. Follow the tour to the famous signal box with its collection of network maps, signals and other artefacts, many of which are still in working order. Clothes, badges and photographs place you firmly in the 1930s. Further along, you''ll find a room with 1950s flair. Of interest not only to technology fans is the still running 14 metre long control panel for signalling and rail switching, and the 1,200 signal lamps that light up your path. During a guided tour, you''ll also learn about junctions, train radio, railway clocks and rare railway switches.
It''s just 10 minutes'' walk from the Berliner U-Bahn-Museum to Olympiapark''s Sports Museum. This is the oldest and largest museum of its kind in Germany and everything is sports related: original equipment, photographs, programmes and autographs. A brand new permanent exhibition is opening here in 2019 in a new exhibition centre within the stadium, where visitors can travel through German sporting history. Cross the Olympic Square, pass Sausuhlensee and you''ll arrive at the Georg Kolbe Museum. The artist''s works are displayed in his former house, studio and sculpture garden. The museum also has visiting exhibitions from artists such as Rodin or Arp. Around 4km east of the U-Bahn-Museum is one of Berlin''s most famous landmarks: Charlottenburg Palace. Visit the magnificent royal rooms; see the New Pavillion, the famous porcelain collection in the Belvedere and Queen Luise''s mausoleum. At Schustehruspark, visit the Villa Oppenheim where you can see an impressive collection of paintings and sculpture from the 19th century.
The U2 line to the Olympia-Stadion will take you directly to the U-Bahn-Museum. The museum is open every second Saturday of the month. Children aged between 6 and 12 can visit for half price, and guided tours have to be booked by telephone during office hours.

1973,Das Verborgene Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/das-verborgene-museum,"
At the beginning of the 20th century, female artists are a rare breed. Their works are sequestered at the back of the most important museums or in dusty archives. That is not the case in Das Verborgene Museum (The Hidden Museum) in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Here you can see the work of overlooked artists. Since its inception 30 years ago, art by women has become a feature of the exhibitions here. The concept of a women-only art museum is unique, and not just in Germany. Discover the versatile works of female artists from the early 20th century and gain a new perspective on art history.

A study between 1984 and 1987 reveals that the works of more than 500 female artists are stored in basements and archives of West Berlin museums. Hardly anyone has access to the work, or knows who the artists are. Dedicated art lovers establish the Hidden Museum Club in 1986. It now undertakes scientific restoration of this body of work to display in Das Verborgene Museum, compiling works from various facilities and estates, and presenting them in exhibitions. The collection of works from the late 19th and early 20th century span painting, photography, sculpture, and architecture. There are even finds from private individuals. More than 100 female artists have returned to public view. Some, thanks to the museum, are now represented in the collections of great museums such as the Berlinische Galerie and the Neue Nationalgalerie.
Around Das Verborgene Museum, you can find many more exhibitions. Only a few minutes away by foot is the Berlin branch of Gallery Brockstedt.

1974,1. Berliner DDR Motorrad Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/1-berliner-ddr-motorrad-museum,"
Over 140 motorcycles, mopeds and scooters are on display in the 1. Berlin DDR Motorradmuseum. All well-known brands of two-wheel production from 40 years of GDR are represented here: Simson, IFA / MZ, IWL or EMW, as well as racing machines and special vehicles. The location is historic and among the six S-Bahn arcs at Alexanderplatz. Along the way, you will also discover the old market street, Markthallenstraße.
The 1. Berliner DDR-Motorradmuseum has existed since 2008 – the old Markthallenstraße, however, is much older. Floor tiles from Villeroy & Boch and granite stones originate from the year 1897. The founders of the museum like the ambience, and they decide to use it in the design. Finding the right atmosphere for the museum is important, so to the left and right of the entrance are images of historical street views. In-between the many two-wheelers on display are life-sized mannequins outfitted in motorcycle gear from the time. The walls display historical photographs and posters of classic bikers riding their motocycles. The exhibition spreads out over almost 1,000 square metres and over two floors. Each model displays a description with year of construction and technical details. You''ll be able to see a Schwalbe-Scooter, or one of few remaining specimens from Honecker''s escort motorcycles. You can still see the original GDR emblem on its front. The Vopo (Volksspolizei) is also on display but is not as impressive in appearance. Racing is represented by the DKW and IFA racing machines, of which there are only a few left in the world. There is also an MZ of the type ETS 250 Trophy Sport from 1970. The creative names given by the manufacturer IWL: Pitty, Wiesel and Troll, are unmistakable. The museum also has a cinema corner showing videos of the exhibits, ideal for a relaxing break.
Visit the Dungeon to experience the Elevator of Doom, the Plagued Street and the Butcher of Berlin, covering 800 years of gloomy Berlin history, only a few minutes’ walk from Alexanderplatz. The Sealife Aquarium is around 100 metres south of the Dungeon with over 4,000 marine animals swimming in natural pools. A special feature is the AquaDom, a big, round glass lift surrounded by fish. Five minutes from the GDR motorcycle museum is Gunther von Hagens'' Menschen Museum. It showcases more than 200 plastinates of the human body, including organs. Get to know the everyday lives of people in the GDR at the DDR Museum, only 10 minutes from the motorcycle museum. True to its motto '"history to touch'", you open the doors into an original GDR living room. At a height of 203 metres, with a panoramic view over Berlin, the television tower (Fernsehturm) has long been a Berlin landmark at Alexanderplatz.
The museum is connected to the S-Bahn lines (S5, S7) and underground lines (U2, U5, U8) to Alexanderplatz. From there it is only a few minutes’ walk. The exhibition is also open on Mondays. Groups of 10 or more and registered groups of 15 or more will receive discounts. With the Berlin WelcomeCard, you also receive a discount.

1975,Zille Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/zille-museum,"
2018 is a year to celebrate Heinrich Zille. On 10 January 2018 the Berlin painter and photographer would have become 160 years old. 
From 2017, the newly reopened Zille Museum in the Nikolaiviertel exhibits a large, new permanent exhibition, titled '"Heinrich Zille - Life and Work'" showcasing the drawings, photographs, prints and letters of original Berliners. Heinrich Zille is not just '"brush-Heinrich'", as Berliners fondly refer to him, but a keenly observing journalist of the Berlin lower class, or '"Milljöh'" of the imperial age. He documents human misery, and is the mouthpiece of the social losers of that era: the '"children of the street'", according to the title of his famous picture book. Zille gives a voice to the scorned; the labourers, drinkers, little crooks and whores. Like no other, he packs his social and critical observations with humorous drawings and stories. The Zille Museum presents Zille and his work in all creative periods.
Located in the historic buildings of the Nikolaiviertel, once a showcase for the GDR, is the Zille Museum. From the outside it looks like a small shop. Through the narrow passageway, you can go straight to the museum shop which sells postcards and books. You then go into the museum with its surprisingly wide rooms. Bright walls, solid parquet and muted lighting make the museum look like a picture gallery. In contrasting images, Zille''s simple motifs are from everyday life in Berlin; you will see drifters all around the Wannseestrand, dancing women, a pregnant woman holding two children in her arms. Over 150 exhibits of painters, graphic artists and photographers are presented here: milieu studies, portrait sketches and nudes - '"doodles'", as Zille calls them. They are pinned to the walls or lie open in glass cases. There is a lot to be found in the cabinet titled '"Erotic of the Master'". Zille writes and draws under the pseudonym W. Pfeifer in the collection titled '"Surgery'", which the censors of 1921 promptly forbid. You will see excerpts of this work, including pornography from the turn of the century. Take a look into the cinema room. Here you can enjoy excerpts from the film '"Det war Zille sein Milljöh'" (1980). They show unique recordings of the artist and his Berlin. Below are interesting self portraits of Zille.
The Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlins offers the possibility to view online the graphic work and related documents by Heinrich Zille
 
The Zille Museum can be reached easily by underground U2 line to Märkisches Museum. It is a mere 500-metre walk to the museum. The Alexanderpllatz transport hub is also very near. Here you will find ample parking facilities. The museum is open on Mondays. Children below 6 enter free of charge. Guided tours for groups and schools are arranged upon request.

1976,Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Decorative Arts ...,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/kunstgewerbemuseum-museum-decorative-arts,"
Art, fashion and design — find it all at the Kunstgewerbemuseum am Kulturforum. Trace the development of art and design from the Middle Ages to the contemporary across over 7,000 square metres. Since 2014, the building also houses the capital''s first permanent fashion exhibition. Curated clothing; from Baroque court costume to haute couture, tell the story of the history of fashion. What''s more, discover precious art treasures like the Portable altar of Eilbertus and Italian Majolica painting. No other object symbolises the origin of neoclassical design like the famous cabinet by David Röntgen. Go on an exciting journey through the history of fashion design in Europe at the continent''s oldest dedicated museum, where you can also see stunning pieces of antique art.
The Kunstgewerbemuseum am Kulturforum opens its doors in 1867. Some of its finest exhibits come from the simultaneous World Exhibition in Paris. Inspirational art, crafts and design objects are used as teaching aids. After the destruction of the premises during the Second World War, some of the most valuable attractions move to Köpenick Palace. The majority, however, remain in West Berlin at Charlottenburg Palace. With the completion of the Kulturforum in 1985, these exhibits migrated to their present location in Potsdamer Platz. The city of Berlin commissions 1960s'' architect Rolf Gutbrod to design the new museum building, one of the leading architects of the time. Typical of his style is the visibility of the building''s constructive components. Opening up to visitors behind this raw facade, is a fascinating world of different materials and shapes. The museum presents precious treasures from an array of eras across multiple storeys. Start your tour of the history of design with the treasures of early Christianity. Magnificent altars and crosses shine with gold and shimmer with rubies. The collection continues with delicate crystal and silver work and valuable chests from the Renaissance. Vases in glass and porcelain and reliquaries in gold and gemstones complete the display. Since 2011, you can immerse yourself in the extensive Fashion Gallery. The fascinating rooms of the Kunstgewerbemuseum am Kulturforum present the history of fashion from the Baroque. The exhibition tour lets you window-shop showcases bringing the story of European art to life through almost 300 models. See dresses by famous fashion designers; Dior, Schiaparelli and Coco Chanel. The collection also includes jewellery and cosmetic paraphernalia. Complete your tour in the Kulturforum''s basement, where you can learn about the beginnings of modern living at the Bauhaus exhibition. The Chair Gallery presents revolutionary designs from the 19th century to the present day.
More visitor magnets can be found at the Berlin Kulturforum such as the Gemäldegallery. An impressive frame, the gallery presents major works of European painting from the 13th to the 18th century. Discover the creations of Hieronymus Bosch, Rembrandt, Paul Peter Rubens and Lucas Cranach the Elder. Just 80 metres south of the Kunstgewerbemuseum, you find St. Matthew''s Lutheran Church. This historic church harbours a secret: the '"Stufen'" (Steps) sculpture. Embedded in the ground, stairs lead down into a white wall of sheet metal: artist Micha Ullman hereby calls for reconciliation between the European Jews and Christians. At the Musikinstrumenten-Museum, you can admire objects that produce sounds. The State Institute for Music Research has more than 800 exhibits here. The Haus am Lützowplatz is a meeting point and hotspot for the contemporary art scene. In a 240 square metre space and adjacent wing, the Art Association holds changing exhibitions of contemporary art. Lectures, film screenings and symposia on changing topics from art to politics and economy complement an otherwise artistic programme.
The Kunstgewerbemuseum am Kulturforum is located within walking distance of Potsdamer Platz and Matthäikirchplatz. Nearby, underground and S-Bahn station Potsdamer Platz includes the U2 and the S-Bahn lines S1, S2 and S25. When you arrive at the square, just walk past the Sony Center towards the Kunstgewerbemuseum. Also within easy reach of the museum are the M29, M41, M48, M85 and 200 buses. The stops are located either directly at or in the vicinity of the museum. There is also a car park at the Sony Center. Children under the age of 18 can visit for free.

1979,Museum Blindenwerkstatt Otto Weidt | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/museum-blindenwerkstatt-otto-weidt,"
Documenting the extraordinary courage of one man during the Third Reich, the Museum Blindenwerkstatt Otto Weidt is situated in the old broom and brush workshop, in which many blind and deaf Jews worked. Since 2006, the exhibition has told the story through its displays of well-preserved photographs, documents, personal letters and other artefacts that illustrate the way the workers lived.
An important producer of brooms and brushes, many of which were destined for the armed forces, Otto Weidt manages to protect a number of his staff from deportation during the Second World War. By obtaining false papers and supplying the workers with food and shelter, he even bribes members of the Gestapo. Today, in the Spandau suburb, the workshop remains almost as it was, with simple wooden floors and workshops fitted with original equipment. Black and white photographs depict scenes of the production, and a picture of Otto Weidt himself hangs on the wall. Letters, poems and postcards of the workers speak of the fear and desperation the people felt, but thank you cards are there as well. They are for food parcels which he sends to the Czech ghetto and concentration camp of Theresienstadt, where some of his former workers are interned. Despite his efforts, some of Weidt’s workers are imprisoned, but the lucky ones manage to hide in a small, windowless room in the furthest corner of the building, the entrance hidden by a clothes cabinet. On the walls are framed photographs of people who have hidden in the Weidt workshop.
A short walk west from the museum takes you to the second oldest Jewish cemetery in Berlin, Friedhof Große Hamburger Straße. In 1671, a group of Jews come to Berlin from Vienna under the special protection of the Elector Friedrich Wilhelm. They settle in nearby Spandauer Tor (Spandau Gate), and here they build their cemetery a year after their arrival. In 1943, the Gestapo orders the cemetery to be destroyed. The graves are desecrated and the cemetery is used as an air raid shelter, with the gravestones being used to reinforce the walls. In 1945, the area is put to its original purpose once again, as the authorities bury masses of civilians and soldiers killed during the Allied raids. In the 1970s, the GDR authorities turn the area into a park.
Philosopher, Moses Mendelssohn is buried here in 1786, and today you’ll find a symbolic tombstone in his name. Preserved gravestones are finally reinstalled in 2008. North of the cemetery, on Koppenplatz, you’ll find a memorial commemorating the Holocaust. Karl Biedermann’s bronze sculpture entitled the Deserted Room depicts a table and two chairs, one of which is overturned. A poem by Nelly Sachs accompanies the piece.
Take the U8 underground line to Weinmeisterstraße, or take the trains S5, S7 or S75 to Hackescher Markt. Both destinations will take you within a couple of minutes’ walk of the museum. Admission is free and there are guided tours every Sunday at 3pm. There is no need to book for these tours, but do book in advance for group tours or special tours for blind, visually impaired and deaf visitors.

1980,3 days in Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/3-days-berlin,"
Are you in Berlin for the first time and don’t want to miss out on any of the highlights in this exciting city? Our 72-hour tour will take you to the most famous landmarks in Berlin and to its most beautiful places. Be guided through a sightseeing tour of Mitte, go shopping on Kurfürstendamm and in City West, and experience neighbourhood life in the districts of Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain. With our 72-hour programme, you won’t miss out on any top sights during your first visit to Berlin.
Start your first day in Berlin at the World Clock at Alexanderplatz. Let the surrounding buildings take you back in time to the GDR of the 1970s, watch the lively goings-on as people pass by and look up across the S-Bahn railway tracks at the TV Tower, the first highlight on the tour. From the top you’ll have a phenomenal view over the whole city, and with the Berlin WelcomeCard you can enjoy a discount on the admission price to the tower. Eat up the view while enjoying breakfast or brunch at the restaurant sphere that rotates over Berlin at a height of 200 metres.
Tickets for the TV Tower
You can continue the tour westwards, past the Rotes Rathaus (red town hall), where the Berlin mayor’s office is. Berlin’s oldest district, the Nikolaiviertel, awaits your visit by the Spree. You can stroll around the picturesque neighbourhood surrounding St. Nicholas’ Church. A bit further downstream of the river on the other side you’ll find the Berlin Cathedral with its gigantic dome – one of Berlin’s landmarks and something you most definitely should not miss.

Back on the magnificent Unter den Linden boulevard, you can see the Berlin City Palace, still under construction, on the left behind the Schlossbrücke (palace bridge). Over Bebelplatz and St. Hedwig’s Cathedral which is a little hidden behind the Staatsoper Unter den Linden (Berlin State Opera), the journey continues with a short detour to Gendarmenmarkt, surely the most beautiful square in Berlin. Enjoy the harmonious ensemble of the concert house in the centre, flanked by the German and French cathedrals, from one of the many restaurants and cafés around the square.
Charlottenstraße on the western side of the square and then Behrenstraße going westwards will now lead you past the Komische Oper to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, which is also known as the Holocaust Memorial. Walk through the memorial with its 2,711 concrete pillars and take in its contemplative atmosphere.
 
 
From here it’s just a few metres down Ebertstraße before you’ll find yourself in front of the most famous landmark of Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate. Few buildings are as closely connected with the history of Berlin as the former city gate is. After the fall of the Berlin Wall it became a symbol of German unity. Following a short walk around Pariser Platz the tour continues through the gate onto the Platz des 18. März. Now you’ll be able to recognise the Siegessäule (Victory Column) in the distance, in the centre of the large Tiergarten park.
The next highlight of our tour is also a truly historic place. The Reichstag, the seat of the Deutscher Bundestag (German parliament), has not only had an eventful history since the Reichstag fire in 1933. You can book a guided tour through the dome – the Alte-Fritz adventure tour is especially worthwhile.
To finish off the tour we recommend either a drink at Capital Beach, directly on the riverbank of the Spreebogenpark with a view of the main railway station – or a beer at Zollpackhof on the other side of the Spree. From there you can also comfortably reach Hackescher Markt, where you can spend the evening at any one of the numerous restaurants, cafés and bars.
Begin your second day like royalty, with a stroll around Charlottenburg Palace. Initially constructed as a summer palace, today it is the most splendid palace in Berlin, with extensive gardens. Located directly by the Spree, you’ll feel like you’ve been transported back in time to the rococo period and the days of the Prussian kingdom as you stroll through the park.
 
A short ride from there on the U7 metro will take you directly to Adenauerplatz in the middle of the legendary Kurfürstendamm – the most famous shopping street in Berlin. Here you can peruse the latest designer fashions or simply marvel at the impressive building façades during your walk along the boulevard. The next highlight is waiting for you at the end of the Ku’damm: the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche (Memorial Church) on Breitscheidplatz. The ensemble consists of the ruins of the church destroyed in the war and a new building next to it. It is a monument for peace and reconciliation and a symbol of Berliners’ will to rebuild in the post-war period.
Today the church is encircled by several tall buildings such as the Upper West, the Zoofenster and the Europa Center, the oldest shopping centre in Berlin. You can reach Kaufhaus des Westens at Wittenbergplatz in just a few minutes via the adjacent Tauentzienstraße. KaDeWe is the most famous department store in Germany. Ansbacher Straße and Kurfürstenstraße will take you to Olof-Palme-Platz. And here waiting for you at the end of the tour are two more highlights: Zoologischer Garten and the Aquarium Berlin, that you can gain reduced admission to with the Berlin WelcomeCard.
You can round off the day right next door, at the Monkey Bar in the 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin. The cocktail bar with panoramic windows offers you a breathtaking view over Tiergarten and City West. Alternatively, you can retreat to the Schleusenkrug on warm summer evenings, a cosy beer garden directly on the Landwehr Canal in Tiergarten.
Enjoy an easy-going start on the third day with a late brunch the way the Berliners love them. Things taste even better when there is a view to match. So check out one of the many cafés by the Landwehr Canal or the Neuköllner Schifffahrtskanal (Neukölln Ship Canal). You can then digest your brunch on a walk along the canal. There are unique gems in the way of restaurants, bars and clubs awaiting your visit. Freischwimmer, Club der Visionäre, Badeschiff and IPSE are just four of the locations on the island that form a summertime bar biotope on the left and right of the Flutgraben channel.
Schlesische Straße and Falckensteinstraße then lead you to Oberbaumbrücke, surely the most picturesque bridge in Berlin. From here you have one of the most beautiful views of Berlin in both directions – towards Alexanderplatz with the TV Tower and out of the city with the Molecule Men in the Spree.
 
 
Just around the corner from Oberbaumbrücke you’ll find the East Side Gallery stretching out before you. The longest connected piece of the former Berlin Wall is covered with many different and amazing artworks. The most famous painting is the brotherly kiss between Honecker and Brezhnev. And there are plenty more historic events depicted along the 1.3 km open air gallery.
Over Schillingbrücke, Bethaniendamm and Mariannenplatz you can continue on until Oranienstraße. From Heinrichplatz to Moritzplatz there are so many bars and restaurants that there is certain to be something to suit all tastes. You can review your stay in Berlin over a beer, wine or cocktail. And for those who wish to venture deeper into the night: the legendary SO36, Prince Charles and Ritter Butzke are just three places for an fun-filled club night.

Tickets
In a building of the former train station, you''ll find one of the world''s best collections of contemporary art. Visit Hamburger Bahnhof museum and see art from the 1960s to the present day. Whether your interest is in Pop Art, Expressionism or Minimalism, the museum will help you understand how each art form has developed. Paintings sit alongside sculpture, video, installation and photography. The museum showcases some of the most important examples of modern art from the past six decades in a 13,000 square metre exhibition space.
The art collections of Marx, Marzona and Flick now all belong to the Hamburger Bahnhof museum. The Nationalgalerie also shows its collection here. This modern art museum''s history starts in the mid 1980s. The Nationalgalerie takes over the private art collection of building contractor Erich Marx, including world famous works by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Anselm Kiefer. The local Berlin government decides on the old station building near the Berlin Wall as a home for this collection, but it remains heavily damaged after the Second World War and requires extensive renovation. Architect Joseph Paul Kleihues is contracted to carry out the reconstruction, and the museum opens its doors in 1996. The Nationalgalerie is home to works by Gerhard Richter, John Cage and Imi Knoebel. The aim of the museum is to encompass all artistic disciplines and to blur boundaries. Visitors will notice, for example, installation art by Michel Majerus, who uses imagery from computer games in his artwork.
The photography section is also outstanding, with works by influential photographers such as Bernd and Hilla Becher, Thomas Ruff and Andreas Gursky. In 2002, Egidio Marzona''s collection is also acquired by the museum, featuring conceptual art and Italian Arte Povera. Finally, collector Christian Flick makes a permanent loan of his collection to the museum, consisting of more than 1,500 works of art. Between and 2012, several pieces of this collection are donated to the museum. Exhibits can be found in Rieckhallen, a neighbouring building and the former warehouse of a freight company. The building alone is impressive: around 6,000 square metres in size, it has a simple black facade made of trapezoidal sheet metal. Flick''s collection consists of conceptual art by artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Bruce Nauman, and media art by Nam June Paik.

Very close to the Hamburger Bahnhof is the government district. Take a look at the seat of power where Germany''s most important decisions are made. Here you can walk past the Bundeskanzleramt, the Reichstag building, MPs offices and the Bundestag offices. It''s worth making a detour to Berlin''s main station, Berliner Hauptbahnhof, opened in 2006 and featuring modern architecture. The Museum für Naturkunde is also close by, its highlight being the skeleton of a Brachiosaurus. This is the largest dinosaur skeleton in the world and stands almost 14 metres tall. In the '"Evolution in Action'" section, don''t miss the biodiversity wall where you can see over 3,000 animals from different habitats. From the museum, Tiergarten is a short distance and provides a space to relax in the open air. Tiergarten also features a beer garden and cafe beside the Neuen See Lake.
It''s easy to get to Hamburger Bahnhof using public transport. From the Berliner Hauptbahnhof, take the Europaplatz exit, and the museum is on the opposite side on Invalidenstraße. By car, the best car park is also at the main railway station. One of the best days to visit is Thursday, as Hamburger Bahnhof is open until 8pm. Children and young people up to the age of 18 can enter for free. With a Museumspass, you can explore the museum for free over three consecutive days.

1983,Willy Brandt Forum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/willy-brandt-forum,"
The relationship between the West and the communist bloc, the popularity of Willy Brandt with GDR citizens, sex scandals and the East German spy Günter Guillaume – all defining moments from Willy Brandt''s time as Chancellor. Gain a real understanding of the politician in the Willy Brandt Forum''s permanent exhibition. This modern museum gives an insight into his professional life and unconventional political style. Delve into the political history of West Germany with documents, photos, films and original recordings. Willy''s private life and personality are also explored.
Willy Brandt is shaped by experiences in his youth. Born Herbert Frahm in Lübeck, he joins the resistance when Hitler comes to power and flees to Norway and then Sweden. He took the pseudonym Willy Brandt for protection and kept it when he returned from exile and became more involved in politics. At the time when East Germany is building the Wall, Brandt becomes mayor of Berlin. He meets with John F. Kennedy at the Rathaus Schöneberg. In 1969, Brandt becomes the first SPD party Chancellor of West Germany and begins the work of building bridges with the East. And that''s only part of what he achieves: Brandt''s life is steeped in history and closely entwined with German history. After he dies, the German government founds the Bundeskanzler-Willy-Brandt-Foundation, which since 2010 has had its headquarters on the famous Unter den Linden boulevard. This is where you''ll find the Willy Brandt Forum today, a political multimedia experience. The exhibition is divided into five themed chapters leading visitors through important events in Brandt''s life, from his Norwegian exile up to his death in 1992. The bright, modern rooms display personal documents and photographs, such as his legal name change document from 1949 and his naturalisation certificate from 1948, all of which tell of his time in Norway and as mayor of a divided Berlin. On the display boards, you can get an overview of the highlights of his life story, and on the multimedia stations, there are videos and audio soundtracks. There is even a special audio tour for younger visitors.
In 1963, Kennedy stands in front of the Rathaus Schöneberg and speaks the famous words '"Ich bin ein Berliner'", and on the 10th of November 1989 Germans celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall in front of the building, which is home to the exhibition now found in the Willy Brandt Forum until 2010. The current exhibition of the city hall carries biographies and stories about Jewish citizens of the Schöneberg district. The SPD party headquarters are housed in the Willy-Brandt-Haus in Kreuzberg, a traditional working class and trendy area of the city. Behind the modern glass and limestone facade, there is a large event and exhibition space. Don''t miss the bronze Willy Brandt statue, already a local landmark.
Take S-Bahn S1, S2, S25 or underground U55 to Brandenburg Gate, and the Willy Brandt Forum is only 200 metres away. Alternatively, take buses 100 or TXL to Brandenburg Gate. Admission is free of charge, and private visits for groups can be arranged by phone or email. Public guided tours take place on Saturdays and Sundays at 1pm. There are additional charges for private group tours on weekdays. Book online using the registration form on the website.

1987,Anne Frank Zentrum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/anne-frank-zentrum,"
Writing in February 1944, just a few months before being captured, Anne Frank documents one of the most fascinating yet tragic passages in her diary: '"The world will keep turning without me, and I can''t do anything to change that. I''ll just concentrate on studying and hope it all works out in the end.'" These sentiments are hugely relevant to young people today, and Anne''s hopes and thoughts form the basis of the exhibition '"Anne Frank. hier & heute'" which is mainly aimed at a younger audience.
The entrance to the Anne Frank Zentrum at Hackescher Markt is covered in street art, and a young Anne Frank looks down from the graffiti, smiling. In 1994 the idea of marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation from fascism is first proposed, and the initial exhibition is a small travelling one. Four years later a permanent centre opens in partnership with the famous Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, and in 2002 it moves to its current location just off Hackescher Markt. Start your tour in a type of time tunnel. On the left you are presented with the main events of Anne''s life starting with her birth in 1929. On the right the parallel, events of the Nazi period show how one young girl is influenced by the political events of her time. You then reach the multimedia stations giving more detailed information about the Frank family''s hiding place in Amsterdam. The original diary belongs to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam but is also loaned to the Berlin centre on occasion. The links to the present day are seen in displays and there are also short films showing young Berliners talking about their personal identity, hopes and dreams as well as discrimination and courage in times of war. There is a wide spectrum of opinions and perspectives and lots of space for visitors to reflect.
Directly opposite the Anne Frank Zentrum is Museum Blindenwerkstatt Otto Weidt, a small factory where Weidt employed Jews to protect them from persecution. Also close by is the Alte Jüdische Friedhof (Old Jewish Cemetery), destroyed by the Gestapo in 1943 and finally reopened in 2008 by Berlin''s Jewish community. The New Synagogue Foundation hosts an exhibition called '"To the Gates'" showing the remains of the old synagogue and telling the story of Jewish life in Berlin. The monument to the women''s protests of 1943 tells the story of the non-Jewish women''s protests over imprisonment of their Jewish husbands. The Mahnmal Neue Wache is a reminder of the tyranny of war. Since 1993, this memorial has hosted the work Mutter mit totem Sohn (Mother with Dead Son) by the renowned artist Kathe Kollwitz.
Take the S-Bahn to Hackescher Markt station for the Anne Frank Zentrum. Berlin WelcomeCard holders get 25% off entrance prices. The Museumspass Berlin gives you free entry to both this and 50 other museums for three consecutive days.
Regular family tours take place at the centre. There is also a children''s discovery quiz with a prize at the end.
Special all-day visits can be arranged for school groups including exhibitions, project and teaching materials. Full details available from the Anne Frank Zentrum.

1990,Mauermuseum - Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie (Wall ...,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/mauermuseum-museum-haus-am-checkpoint-charlie-wall-museum,"

  Since 1962, the Mauermuseum - Haus am Checkpoint Charlie has been telling the stories of people fleeing from East Germany and the history of the Berlin Wall.
  

Checkpoint Charlie is an iconic symbol of the division of Germany. In 1961, as East Germany is building a wall, you find American tanks stationed here. At the same time, resistance fighter Rainer Hildebrandt is building the Mauermuseum. Its mission: to catalogue escape plans as well as support escape attempts. Now the Mauermuseum is known for its extensive collection of items from 30 years of history, such as cars and hot air balloons that tell the stories of how successful escapees did it.
Overnight in 1961, the East German authorities start building a wall through Berlin. For the next 30 years, it''s not just the dividing line between capitalism and communism, but also between families. Stretching for over 155 km and equipped with watchtowers, the Wall seals off West Berlin. Refugees from the East start to arrive in West Berlin, and Rainer Hildebrandt starts to record their stories, starting the museum in his flat in 1962. A year later, the museum relocates to a building immediately adjacent to Checkpoint Charlie. Hildebrandt''s museum soon becomes a focal point for escapees, helpers, journalists and protesters. Helpers provide the Checkpoint Charlie house with vehicles, tools and personal mementos. Innovative and full of information - this is the impression you get from the Mauermuseum - Haus am Checkpoint Charlie today. Take a look through the inventive methods people have used to escape from the GDR, such as a concealed luggage compartment in a VW car, a mini-submarine, a hot air balloon and a collapsed suitcase. Some of these methods actually work, and you can see how at the museum. The museum is also a gallery where international artists like Hannah Höch and Bulatow exhibit their works. Permanent displays look beyond Berlin and Germany with titles such as From Gandhi to Walesa, NATO Mission for Freedom and Raoul Wallenberg Lives.
Only a few steps from the Mauermuseum at Checkpoint Charlie is the Trabi museum, right in the former border area, which is open for tours showing everyday life in the GDR. Find out more about East German car making and its most famous product - the cult Trabant. It is on display in all colours and variations. It''s 20 minutes on the underground from Checkpoint Charlie to the DDR Museum. This interactive exhibition showcases everyday life in East Germany. There''s a lifelike East German living room, complete with the typical fitted wall furniture. Full of nostalgic everyday objects from the GDR, the museum also features a Stasi listening station to show you what life was really like in communist Berlin.
Take the U6 underground to Kochstraße/Checkpoint Charlie station, just outside the museum entrance. The museum is open on Mondays and holidays and opens late in the evenings. Groups of 25 or more get a discount as do students and children. Children under 7 can visit for free. Berlin WelcomeCard holders get 25% off admission. You will need a 2-euro coin for the lockers, and audio guides are available on site.
Mauermuseum - Haus am Checkpoint Charlie organises special events and meetings for student groups. These can be booked in advance by email. Internships and workshops may also be possible.

1992,Lippenstift-Museum (Lipstick Museum) René Koch ...,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/lippenstift-museum-lipstick-museum-rene-koch,"
It is one of the most unusual exhibitions in Berlin: the make-up artist René Koch personally brings you the history of lipstick. The Lipstick Museum is housed on the chic premises of a private flat. The collection is extensive and shows you rarities from the Baroque period up until today. The collection includes precious stone-studded lipsticks, historical make-up cases and former everyday products such as the DDR people''s lipstick. Insider knowledge, anecdotes and make-up tips are also on offer.
Lipstick Museum René Koch shows that red lips are not only to be kissed, they also want to last. His private collection has been open to the public since 2009, and there are more than 250 exhibits here. They include lipsticks and advertising from more than 200 years, luxurious make-up cases and even some dresses worn by Marlene Dietrich. On the walls are images of historical film-makers from the silent film and early sound film era with famous divas. Classic songs play in the background, providing the right atmosphere. Particular rarities are the lipsticks of the Baroque era and lip colour from Japan or Africa. In its present form, the lipstick has only existed since the 19th century. The museum curator likes to tell about the development of the product - and the associated change in how women presented themselves. Another highlight is the more than 150 kiss prints of great divas of film and television history. Among those represented are Hildegard Knef, Mireille Mathieu, Bonnie Tyler and others. From other personalities like Evita Perón or Paloma Picasso, you can see whole lipstick collections and make-up utensils. If you would like to learn more, join René Koch''s make-up workshops.
About 15 minutes by bus or train from the Lipstick Museum is the Museum der Unerhörten Dinge (Museum of Unheard Things) on Crellestraße. This museum shows you a collection of curious objects from everyday life, art, technology and science. The owner, Roland Albrecht, exhibits things that are real and some that are fictitious. The Schwules Museum (gay museum) in Lützowstraße is also a quarter-hour bus ride away. The LGBTIQ scene has been part of life and culture since the 1980s, and the museum is among the largest and most important of its kind in the world.
Lippenstift-Museum René Koch is located in the private rooms of René Koch. It is located between the two underground stations Berliner Straße and Bayerischer Platz. These can be reached using lines U4, U7 or U9. Alternatively, the bus to use is 104. It is only about a 5 minute walk from both metro stations to the museum. For a visit to the Lipstick Museum please make an appointment in advance and you will be received by René Koch personally. Group tours for up to 15 people are also possible. You can also enjoy beauty workshops and lectures. You can reach René Koch and his team by e-mail or telephone from Wednesday to Friday.

1993,Werkbundarchiv - Museum der Dinge (Museum of Things),https://www.visitberlin.de/en/werkbundarchiv-museum-der-dinge-museum-things,"
From the purist vase to the kitsch snow globe – the Museum der Dinge deals with objects from everyday life. It is centred around the German Werkbund (DWB), a society that values aesthetic things that are simple and useful. See for yourself how history has unfolded between 1907 and today. The Museum of Things shows you a cross-section of the world of everyday things in wooden display cases.
In 1907, artists and entrepreneurs establish the Deutscher Werkbund. Everyday things have become too alien for them. They want objects that are honest, functional, simple and sustainable. The Werkbund designs objects, but always focuses on the future. That''s why the DWB founds the Werkbundarchiv Berlin in 1971. Here, the group documents and reflects on the history of product culture. It amasses a sizeable collection ranging from aesthetic commodities to souvenirs, high-profile designer pieces to NoName mass productions. There are now over 20,000 ''things'' housed here. As you go through the repository, situated in a factory building, wooden display cases are stacked with characteristic blue Nivea cans. In another, a crowd of toy figures - Smurfs, Garfield, or Donald Duck. The line between garage and commercial value is quickly blurred. A different case is dominated by simple design: curved glass vases and functional watering cans. The museum has arranged the collection deliberately. In the central room, display cabinets are organised thematically. Here you will find the works of the German Werkbund, that both contrast and are congruent with the objects of today. A unique exhibit is the Frankfurt kitchen. Designed in 1926 by Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, this standardised kitchen is a prime example of the response to the urban housing shortage and rising population figures after World War II. Economic, efficient, and cheap housing was accompanied by simple facilities. Its combination of aesthetics and efficiency places it at the core of German Werkbund values: sustainable, rational and functional.
In the Kreuzberg art space Bethanien, encounter themed contemporary art exhibitions. The building is a former Deaconess Hospital with a gripping history. Famous in the 1970s, it was a centre for political activists. In the neuen Gesellschaft für bildende Kunst, art is presented democratically. The members of the association decide their exhibition programme at the annual meeting. Featured artists are mostly young, international, often controversial and always focus on social issues. You will find the nGbK in a former safe factory.
You can reach the museum via underground lines U1/U3 and U8 to Kottbusser Tor. Note that the museum is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Admission is free for those up to 17 years of age. Every Sunday at 14:00 you can participate in a free public guided tour. There are also special workshops and themed tours for school classes and groups. Group discounts are possible. For more information, refer to the museum website.

1995,Museum der Unerhörten Dinge - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/museum-der-unerhorten-dinge,"

  At the Museum der Unerhörten Dinge, discover Roland Albrecht''s collection of oddities, including Columbus'' alleged telescope and the fur of a bonsai deer.
  

In the Museum der Unerhörten Dinge (Museum of Extraordinary Things), fiction blurs with reality: in just 20 square metres, all sorts of curious objects abut each other. Founder Roland Albrecht has woven real or invented stories around all these things. Whether the stories are true, is up to your imagination. The museum opens up a world of curiosities, viewed through artefacts that offer unique perspectives on pivotal historical moments such as Columbus'' discovery of America. The scope of the collection includes a petrified potato, psyllium and hamburger bacon. Again and again, quirky items are labelled with equally quirky explanations: fossilised rice, acorn olives and white red wine.
Roland Albrecht came into the world in 1950, in Memmingen in Bavaria. Fascinated from childhood by the bizarre, he began to collect rarities of any kind. Everything began with his acquisition of the alleged telescope of Columbus. Peering through it as a small boy, Albrecht started to drift into a world of fantasy. As he says, the collection snowballed from there and was housed in Berlin from 2000. The Museum der Unerhörten Dinge is located in a literal ''nowhere'', in the space between the doorways of Crellestraße 5 and 6. So a visit to this tiny Berlin museum is also a journey beyond the facade of reality. More than 400 items are on show in the museum. On its walls hang texts and artefacts with fascinating histories; hip joints, the fur of a bonsai deer, a 22 metre-high relief of Soviet space dog Laika and film snippets with secret subliminal messages. Roland Albrecht interweaves fiction with reality, and discovering which story is true and which invented seems almost impossible. Whether you try to disentangle them or not, at the Museum der Unerhörten Dinge, you leave the everyday world for a moment of fantasy.
At the Under the Mango Tree gallery, you can explore Mini Kapur''s world of photography, design and art. Only 600 metres from the Museum der Unerhörten Dinge, the gallery shows contemporary artists such as Joris Göritz and Monika Rauscher. Exhibitions change with a quarter to half-yearly rhythm. You''ll find fair trade designer fashion from India at the gallery shop. A full concerts and readings programme at the nearby Kleistpark House on Grunewaldstraße features regional artists in a 240-square-metre exhibition area. Soak up its purist ambiance, surrounded by artworks by three monthly exhibitions of work by artists such as Clara Bahlsen, Adriana Lestido and Lea Gilloire.
The S-Bahn S1 station Julius-Leber-Brücke is just 200 metres from the Museum der Unerhörten Dinge. Alternatively, take the U7 to Kleist Park. If you are arriving by car, you will find car parks at Gleisdreieck and Bülowstraße. Please note that the museum is only open three days a week in the afternoon. Admission is free.

1996,Schwules Museum* (Gay Museum*) | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/schwules-museum-gay-museum,"
Visiting the Schwules Museum (Gay Museum) takes you on a walk through the history of Berlin''s LGBT community. Find out about the life of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, gay icon and transvestite in former East Germany. In the main exhibition space, you can see photos, videos, postcards, letters and items of clothing. There is also a library and archive where you can browse through university publications or lifestyle magazines from the 1990s. Stay later and catch an evening lecture on topics as diverse as experiences of coming out, celebrity culture or sad testimonies about persecution and intolerance.
Berlin needs a museum for gay history! In the 1980s, students Andreas Sternweiler, Wolfgang Theis and Manfred Baumgardt make that possible. In 1984, the first exhibition opens, entitled '"Eldorado - Homosexual Women and Men in Berlin 1850-1950'" within the exhibition space of the Berlin Museum. The project that is frowned upon by some, but the students continue with the aim of increasing acceptance and tolerance. The following year, the '"Association of Friends of a Gay Museum in Berlin'" is formed with a change of venue: a museum with a library and archive is installed in a building belonging to AHA, a gay rights working group. The first exhibition takes place on the 750th anniversary of Berlin''s founding and is a huge public success. As the library and the archive grows, the museum changes location twice more. Today, researchers visiting the Lützowstraße building have access to a huge collection of material from the gay scene. Just head to the archive in the basement, where you can see over 50,000 objects ranging from old postcards to vinyl records and VHS tapes. Since 2008 there has been an exhibition about the history of lesbians, transgender and people of all sexual identities, also known as queer or LGBTI*. The asterisk found on the logo of the Gay Museum symbolises this inclusivity. Take a break in the ground floor cafe where you can browse through more photos and letters, and learn about gay trailblazers and their struggle for respect and acceptance. On the first floor is the library where you can read, research and rummage your way through 16,000 volumes.

2000,Ramones Museum Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/ramones-museum-berlin,"
It''s the early 1970s in the United States. In the Queens district of New York City, a group of musicians become distinctive for their hard guitar riffs and heavy drum rhythms. In 1974, the Ramones take to the stage and help launch the American punk movement. They quickly become underground icons in clubs such as CBGB, arriving in Germany not long afterwards. The Ramones Museum in Berlin is dedicated to the punk rock musicians - a place of pilgrimage for fans since 2005.
Flo Hayler is a Ramones fan. In 1990, he goes to his first concert, and becomes a devotee of the punk rock band, this gig marking the beginning of a lifelong passion. Starting with posters, he hoards T-Shirts and all possible memorabilia. To the annoyance of his girlfriend, his collection grows proportionally to fill his small Berlin flat. And indeed, Hayler collects so much Ramones memorabilia that he now has enough to fill a museum. In 2005, he opened the first Ramones Museum in Berlin, and the world. Head to Kreuzberg to admire 500+ items from the Ramones'' history. A café with snacks, coffee and, of course, beer completes the punk picture. Explore exhibition spaces decorated like packed living rooms. Photos, information and history pour out of display cases and cover the walls.
Ramones Museum Berlin follows the career of the band chronologically: the early CBGB''s appearances, charts, and the 1996 farewell concert. All these cult objects date from the period between 1975 and 1996, and include rare t-shirts, backstage photographs and signed records. There''s also paraphernalia once owned by the Ramones themselves, including an original trainer belonging to Marky Ramone. Watch band documentaries in the cinema. All memorabilia is kept in the old-Berlin style that has made the museum a place of pilgrimage for fans. Additionally, it also holds live concerts and readings.
Across the Spree River from the Ramones Museum, you can experience the Wall Museum at East Side Gallery. In 13 themed rooms filled with multimedia exhibitions, this museum conveys the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall and the consequences of the division of Germany. A lovely half hour walk along the river Spree will take you to the Soviet Memorial at Treptower Park. This massive monument with huge statues of Soviet soldiers is an impressive sight, as well as a nice place to relax and hang out on a summers'' day.
The U-bahn U1 will take you directly to Schlesisches Tor station, only a few minutes'' walk from the Ramones Museum. Buses 165 and 216 also stop here. On the other side of the river, you will find Warschauer Straße station, where S-Bahn lines 5, 7 and 75 and tram number 10 run. You can visit the exhibition until late in the evening and also on Mondays, and the museum offers life-time tickets to loyal guests.

2002,Deutsches Historisches Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/deutsches-historisches-museum,"
Housed in the baroque Zeughaus on Unter den Linden, the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historical Museum) tells the story of 2,000 years of German history. Across 8,000 square metres and 7,000 exhibits you can chart the conquests of Charlemagne, uncover Luther''s Theses, learn about the origins of the Second World War and get acquainted with German reunification. A chronologically-arranged layout takes you from the early-Middle Ages to the present day. The exhibits shift engagingly between art and everyday objects: paintings of historical scenes sit alongside armour, a vacuum cleaner alongside GDR sheet music.
In 1987, Chancellor Helmut Kohl signs the founding document for the museum on the 750th anniversary of the city. A historical boom creates the right context for such a large project. The Federal Government is confident about the ambitious plan and lays the foundation stone on Berlin''s Spreebogen. Then the wall falls and everything changes. The still youthful Deutsches Historisches Museum Foundation receives all relevant collections and moves into the Zeughaus. In 2003, the architectural icon Ieoh Ming Pei designs an additional exhibition hall for temporary exhibitions. The large permanent exhibition through which you pass today opens in 2006. '"German History in Images and Artefacts'" encompasses nine eras across two floors, filled to capacity with art and history. Move chronologically through the upper floor, which begins with the Middle Ages. Here you can see a collection of armour, presented in great detail. Then view filigree-embroidered tunics belonging to princes and knights from c.1750. Across the imperial age you can see two-wheeled penny farthings and the very first automobiles.
The tour then takes you to the first floor where you''ll find photographs and old election posters from the Weimar Republic. The rooms on the years following 1945 are concerned with the difficult period of reparation. See original CARE packages from the United States and maps of German occupied zones. The tour eventually leads you to an original piece of the Berlin Wall and on through the 1990s. All exhibits in the museum look at historical processes, revolutionary events, and fundamentally, the people behind them. The exhibition offers insight not only into the big stories and epoch-making figures, but also small everyday experiences. Again and again at the Deutsches Historisches Museum you are immersed in the lives of everyday people. You will find alms bowls, women''s fashion from the 19th century and even tickets to the Nuremberg war crimes trials.
From the Deutsches Historisches Museum, you can visit the Neue Wache right next door. It is the central memorial site for victims of war and tyranny. The bronze sculpture '"Mother with her Dead Son'" by Käthe Kollwitz sits inside, inviting you in for a moment of reflection. Located just a few minutes away you''ll find the Forum Willy Brandt Berlin. Here you will learn about the fourth Chancellor, from his days as a young worker in Lübeck to his metamorphosis into a globally-respected statesman. The German Bundestag''s art collection holds regularly changing exhibitions, presenting works from the contemporary art scene. About 15 minutes away from the Zeughaus lies the Tränenpalast. '"Border experiences - life during the division of Germany'" is the title of its permanent exhibition. The nearby DDR Museum presents the daily life of GDR citizens. Take a simulated '"Trabi'" ride and browse cabinets, hear music played on a carat turntable and enter a prefabricated apartment. Berlin City Palace and the new Humboldt Forum are also situated a mere 800 metres away.
The Deutsches Historisches Museum is best reached by public transport. Hackescher Markt and Friedrichstraße S-Bahn stops are under 15-minutes walk away. The nearest underground station is Alexanderplatz. The buses 100, 200 and TXL stop almost right in front of the entrance. Motorists can find paid parking in the City-Quartier DOM-Aquarée garage, or in the underground car park at Bebelplatz. With the Berlin WelcomeCard, you get 25% discount on the entrance fee. Children and young people under 18 may visit the museum for free. The museum is also open on Mondays. Guided tours run regularly (for a fee). Advance booking is not necessary. Groups and schools can book special tours in advance. Note that films at the Zeughaus cinema often supplement special exhibitions in the museum.

2003,Trabi Museum Berlin | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/trabi-museum-berlin,"
The Trabi has long been a favourite with race car enthusiasts, both past and present. Rattling engines and the historically long waiting list to get one prove the cult car from the East Germany isn''t perfect, but still hugely popular. Production of the Trabant ceased in 1991, but former owners can still feel nostalgic about their old cars. The Trabant has become a cult car, and now the museum in Berlin attracts visitors from all over the world. A visit to the Trabant museum will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about the car, and you can even take a Trabant safari through the city. The museum at Checkpoint Charlie has classic Trabants such as the 601, alongside rarer rally cars.
The cult of the Trabant has been going strong for more than 25 years. In 2013, a museum dedicated to this iconic car opens at Checkpoint Charlie on the ground floor of a huge 19th century building, with the aim of preserving the history of East German car making. In 1958 the first model rolls off the production line, somewhat reminiscent of the VW Beetle. Trabants are displayed in chronological order, including the rare P50 and P60 models. The classic Trabant is the 601, which survives all the way up to the reunification of Germany. All variations and colours of the 601 are on display, including the campervan model. Look out for rare Trabi rally cars, military vehicles, jeeps and police cars. For a while, you''ll be transported back to the GDR. The museum''s oldest vehicle is the DKW, dating from the 1930s. Watch a film about the importance of Trabis in East German culture in the on-site cinema. Finish your visit in the shop, where you can buy souvenirs such as model Trabants. Right next door is TrabiWorld, a car rental place where you can get behind the wheel of a Trabi and hit the Berlin streets.
Just a few steps from the Trabi Museum at Checkpoint Charlie is the Cold War Museum. This tells the story of escape attempts across the border zone between East and West Berlin. Of particular interest is the original items used in escapes - everything from a car boot to a hot air balloon, and even mini-submarines and homemade surfboards. Also nearby is the German Currywurstmuseum, where you can learn everything about the invention of this classic German snack in the post-war era. The museum is highly interactive, and of course there''s a chance to sample the snack itself. Children will also enjoy making sausages with the CurryUp! computer game.
Take the U6 underground line to Kochstraße/Checkpoint Charlie station, emerging by the large portraits of soldiers on Friedrichstraße. Walk to the corner of Zimmerstraße and turn left. 100m along this street brings you to the Trabi museum, which is open daily. Children under 12 get in for free, and groups recieve a discount on request. Berlin WelcomeCard holders receive a 50% discount on the admission price.

2005,Berlin Story Museum - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-story-museum,"

  Discover the history of Berlin on a chronological journey through the city''s history in an unusual museum located in a bunker close to Anhalter station.
  

The Berlin Story is located in a bunker at Anhalter Station. A compact site, the museum has been designed to take you on a journey through 800 years of Berlin life with 30 different displays. Some of the multimedia displays include large scale photographs, short films, sculpture and other art installations. Follow the guided tour through history from the time of Frederick the Great in the 18th century through the German Empire under Bismarck until the late 20th century and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Each area has a different scene from history such as the home of a poor family from 1880, complete with original wooden floors, oil lamp lighting and a bean-snapping machine. Another scene tells the story of the lives of the so-called Trümmerfrauen, women who cleaned up Berlin''s rubble after the Second World War bombings.
One of the striking aspects of the Berlin Story is its location: a huge concrete bunker built during the First World War. At that time, the bunker is linked by many corridors to the Anhalter Railway Station. Thousands of Berlin residents seek refuge there during air raids. Over time, the slogan He who builds the bunker drops the bombs is painted in graffiti on the walls, a saying which has become a hallmark of the museum. Both the nature of the material and the subterranean location adds to the atmosphere of the museum. As you start your Berlin Story Museum visit, you are led to the lower floor, collecting your audio guide as you go. The next stop is The Gate which tells the story of the Brandenburg Gate through large photo panels. Then it''s onto, among other things, 20th century section with book burning by the Nazi party in the 1930s. The GDR section includes the Palace of the Republic''s impressive porcelain service. A visit to the Berlin Story gives a taste of what is available in greater detail in many other museums in the city.

In the same bunker you can visit an exhibition about Hitler. How could it happen that so many voted for Hitler? How did he become a Nazi? How did he get to power? How did anti-Semitism lead to concentration camps and the Holocaust? Why did generals and soldiers participated until the very end? With the suicide of the dictator Hitler actually ended the bloody war of history. The reconstruction of his original bunker space as well as a model of the driver''s bunker, photos, documents and films can be seen.
The black box at Checkpoint Charlie will explain the story of the Cold War with 16 multimedia displays and also a small cinema and original objects from the period. The Mauer Museum features a display of escape cars, hot air balloons and mini-submarines. The Checkpoint Charlie is also where you''ll find The Wall, a large circular artwork by Yadegar Asisi depicting life in East and West Germany during the 1980s. If you are interested in science, visit the Deutsche Technikmuseum. Take a look at the Douglas C-47B Skytrain plane on the roof. The Berlin Gallery, with artworks from the 1870s, is also worth a visit.
Take the S1, S2 or S25 lines to Anhalter Station, from where the Berlin Story Museum is just three minutes walk away. The Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park underground station is also close by. The entrance price includes your audio guide, and a discount is available for Berlin WelcomeCard holders. Last admission at 6 pm.
Pre-booked groups of ten or more get a reduced entry price. School groups can visit unaccompanied by using the audio guide, and there is an interesting quiz to support learning.

2007,Menschen Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/menschen-museum,"
No other museum in Berlin’s recent history has fascinated and caused as much debate as the Menschen Museum (MeMu), the first museum by the creators of BODY WORLDS, Dr. Gunther von Hagens and Dr. Angelina Whalley. Since opening in February 2015, more than 230,000 visitors (until April 2016) have made it one of the most visited, private museums in Germany’s capital. Situated directly at Alexanderplatz, the MeMu dares to go beyond the structure of the human body – it shows what connects us, what keeps us upright, in motion, what makes us laugh and what makes us love. It shows the complexity, resilience, and vulnerability of the human body and describes organ functions and common diseases in an easily understood way. Plastinates in lifelike poses allow a direct connection with the viewers own body. But the MeMu is more than just an anatomy exhibition that shows the complexity of the human body''s inner structure: A tour invites visitors to a gain a deeply touching and inspiring encounter with life, through intense awareness of one''s own physical body. Visitors are invited to take stock of their lives through contemplation and mediation in a considered approach to discover what it means to be human and what makes us human. The specimens on display were preserved through Plastination, the preservation process invented by Dr. Gunther von Hagens in 1977 at the University of Heidelberg. They stem from people who have consented to donate their bodies for the education of medical professionals and the general public after their death. Audio guides are available in German and English and enrich the visit to a further dimension. Clear explanations, amazing facts and more information about the plastinates is accessed by individual users at thier own pace. The two hour program is designed for non-medical professionals, and is included in the ticket price.
The MeMu offers a reduced family ticket price. Many families find the exhibition visit is helpful in discussing the function of the human body, prevention of disease, health and well-being. Additional material is available to download for free on the MuMu website to prepare for and to follow up your visit. Children age 8 years on can participate in the '"Junior-Doktor Workshops'" (in German) where they experience the world of anatomy in a playful way and earn a certificate of completion.
The MeMu offers reduced prices for school classes and groups of more than 10. Accompanying teachers are admitted for free. Teachers are invited to preview the exhibition free of charge before bringing their classes. Educator materials to accompany the exhibition are available to download for free on the website. The exhibition, materails and workssheets allow students to further explore the human body systems, from the musculoskeletal system to the nervous system.
The MeMu is fully wheelchair accessible. Please use the elevator at the ground level of Alexanderplatz (next to Neptunbrunnen) to access the entrance area of the museum on the 1st floor. The exhibition and the handicapped lavatory are located on the 1st floor.

Last admission: 18.00.

2008,German Spy Museum | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/german-spy-museum,"
The German Spy Museum Berlin at Leipziger Platz allows you to explore the exciting universe of agents and the secret service. Using state-of-the-art technology, you can experience a multi-media journey through the history of espionage. Your journey begins with secret scriptures from antiquity and ends in the present, with the recent NSA debate. You gain insight into elaborate spy techniques, legendary cases and spectacular secret operations. Hear former agents speaking about their secret lives. The German Spy Museum Berlin is the only museum of its kind in Germany. The collection comprises more than 1,000 exhibits. 300 of these are on display, across various themed areas. You''ll also find interactive installations, inviting you to participate.
As soon as you enter the museum, you experience the sinister world of espionage as several cameras peer down on you. The resulting surveillance blend with other film snippets on a monitor wall, creating a flickering collage. You can then walk through the “Zeittunnel” (time tunnel). This leads into the 3,000m² museum. The story of espionage begins here, both in digital form and through historical objects. Among the objects on display in the German Spy Museum Berlin, are umbrellas with integrated poison arrows, gloves hiding a pistol and shoes with bugging devices in the heel. Touch screens allow you to view these bizarre objects from different angles. The screens also offer exciting information about the exhibits themselves.
You can even see what it takes to become a top secret agent - hack computers and crack codes. Test your agility on the exciting laser course and feel like Tom Cruise in “Mission: Impossible.” Berlin is not only regarded as an important historical site during the Cold War, but also as the former spy capital. It is for this reason that curator Franz-Michael Günther opens the museum. He starts his collection 2004, sourcing objects and information from former secret service workers, double agents and contemporary witnesses. The location of the museum at Leipziger Platz is also of importance, as the square lies on the former border between East and West Berlin: on the “death strip” of the Berlin Wall. Therefore, a focus of the museum is the two superpowers: the United States of America and the Soviet Union.

Directly behind the German Spy Museum Berlin, you will see the last GDR “BT 6” watchtower from 1966. You can enter the tower itself and enjoy panoramic views of the former border area. Naturally, the shooting ranges have long been out of use. The Checkpoint Charlie Museum is another a fascinating place to visit, sitting on the spot where the former powers of East and West met directly. The museum focuses on the escape attempts of GDR citizens to the west. Original exhibits can be seen here, including a mini-submarine, testifying to the creativity and daring of people in pursuit of their freedom. The museum also addresses worldwide human rights issues, including the story of Mahatma Gandhi. In the Black Box at Checkpoint Charlie you can learn details of the Cold War. The world held its breath when in 1961, Soviet and American tanks faced each other down on this very spot. There are media stations, a cinema and fascinating exhibits. For those who enjoy cult cars, visit the nearby Trabi Museum. It includes curiosities such as a Trabi car with a wooden frame. Visit “The Wall” by artist Yadegar Asisi for a glimpse of 1980s life in West Berlin. Within the steel structure, you can view an enormous panoramic image of a divided Berlin, following the course of the wall.
The German Spy Museum Berlin is located directly at U-Bahn and S-Bahn station Potsdamer Platz. You can reach it by taking underground line U2, the S-Bahn (S1, S2, S25) and bus lines 200, M41 and M48. The Berlin WelcomeCard offers free public transport around the clock. If you are driving, you will find ample parking in the car parks at Potsdamer Platz and the Sony Centre. Generally, the German Spy Museum Berlin runs hourly tours. For school groups, 60 and 90-minute tours are available upon request. The numerous, and often bizarre, exhibits from the Cold War are fascinating for all ages.

2009,Museum Europäischer Kulturen (Museum of European Cultures),https://www.visitberlin.de/en/museum-europaischer-kulturen-museum-european-cultures,"

  A changing Europe in constant cultural exchange with the surrounding world: Travel through four centuries of history at the Museum Europäischer Kulturen.
  

The collection of the Museum of European Cultures (MEK) offers a unique insight into European everyday culture and popular art with around 280,000 cultural-historical objects. The main focus is on encounters between people of different origins and the consequences of these contacts for society in the past and present. By collecting the present and working with different people and communities from all over Europe, the museum accompanies current social and cultural processes. Intercultural understanding should be encouraged and prejudices should be reduced.
Many exhibits from the Museum Europäischer Kulturen come from the Museum für Volkskunde and from the Ethnologisches Museum. These collections are brought together in the Bruno-Paul building in Berlin-Dahlem in 1999. By 2011, the building is renovated and the exhibits are rearranged and given new descriptions. Upon entering the museum courtyard, take some time to enjoy the beauty of this historic building. Walk through the dark wooden doors into the foyer. On the ground floor, you will encounter the first highlight; a splendid Venetian gondola that stands grandly upon a pedestal. Opposite the gondola, some of Europe''s many textiles are presented. Through clothing, you will get an insight into the everyday culture of centuries past. In the light from the windows, a wooden cart with magnificent pictorial motifs appears. The colourful vehicle was built for Emperor Wilhelm II on a trip to Sicily. In the hallway is the bright Corpus Christi altar of the Heinzelmann family from the 1920s. The best is a saved for last: in the dim light of the grand museum awaits the mechanical Christmas mountain, where 328 movable figures depict the most important scenes of the life of Jesus Christ. This exhibition is the result of a cultural exchange between Catholic Bohemia, the Protestant Saxon and the world of the Erzgebirge mountain workers.
Southwest Berlin abounds in outstanding museums and exhibition centres, situated in an attractive natural and cultural landscape. Berlin''s Green Museum Quarter offers leisure and education, history, recreation and creative inspiration like no other area in the city. Here you can find the most diverse institutions, displaying everything from ancient to modern art, from natural to cultural history. The institutions are open, living museums and exhibition venues, committed to a common idea: recreation between culture and nature.
The Domäne Dahlem is an open-air museum situated just 600m from the Museum Europäischer Kulturen. This ecological farm of agricultural and nutritional culture houses farm animals, right bang in the middle of Berlin. From here, walk for 30 minutes towards Grunewaldsee. There you will find the 16th century castle Jagdschloss Grunewald, built by Elector Joachim II. It is the oldest surviving building of its kind in Berlin.
The best way to reach the museum is by underground (U3) or bus (M11, X83) via the stop Dahlem-Dorf. Those travelling by car can park in the Contipark Parkhaus Steglitzer Kreisel or in the Parkhaus APCOA. Although you are still half an hour from the museum, the route features a beautiful botanical garden. That''s thirty minutes well spent in the lap of nature. Consider visiting the museum on the fourth Saturday of the month for a guided tour. The Museumspass Berlin gives you 3-day free entry to all National Museums in Berlin.

The Steglitz Museum is located in an art nouveau mansion in one of the oldest streets of the city’s Lichterfelde district. It tells the story and many small anecdotes of the city districts of Steglitz, Lankwitz, Lichterfelde and Südende. Visitors can discover the vestiges of the life and times of people in the Steglitz district: from the Wandervogel movement established in Steglitz in 1901 and the world’s first electric streetcar in Lichterfelde to the story of the aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal and his brother Gustav, who built numerous Lichterfelde homes in a very special style. Special exhibitions deal with urban development and contemporary history, such as the construction of the Teltow Canal or the Nazi era and the end of the war in Steglitz, but also refresh our memory of forgotten artists.

2012,Museum The Kennedys | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/museum-kennedys,"

  The museum The Kennedys tells visitors about the life and history of America''s famous family including the circumstances of JFK''s '"Ich bin ein Berliner'" speech.
  

John F. Kennedy has been a legend in the German capital since he spoke the words '"Ich bin ein Berliner'" in a speech in 1963. The Kennedys takes a very personal look at America''s 35th President. The main display is of photographs, but you will also find documents and personal items such as his suit and briefcase. This exhibition also covers other members of the family: his wife and First Lady Jackie and his brother, Robert, who was also assassinated. Museum The Kennedys explores political success and the President''s private life, following the American Dream through to the presidential election and his assassination.
The organisation behind The Kennedys is CAMERA WORK, a group which in 2004 puts on their first exhibition about the Kennedys to positive acclaim. CAMERA WORK goes on to open a permanent display about the family in Pariser Platz, and in 2012 the museum moves into part of the former Jewish Girls'' School. Explore the long, white and light-flooded corridors of the school, and experience the displays in the former classrooms where the walls are decorated with photographs. The main theme is John F. Kennedy''s visit to Germany, but the museum also covers the myth of the American Dream and his presidential election campaign. Alongside the photographs sit some political and more mundane objects: historic books and original documents are displayed in glass cabinets. Some more personal objects include JFK''s trademark handmade designer suits and bags. Film footage is projected onto the wall on an endless loop. The museum''s collection also covers other members of the Kennedy family; JFK''s wife Jackie, his younger brother, Robert, and the rest of the First Family. Find out about their life in the spotlight.
Alongside the museum The Kennedys, CAMERA WORK runs another gallery in the school building. The CWC Gallery has a regularly changing programme of exhibitions of contemporary art featuring sculpture, photography and paintings in a minimalist and elegant space. Temporary exhibitions showcase the best of contemporary art, for example, the close-up star portraits by Martin Schoeller or Marc Sijan''s sculptures. The Collectors Room also looks at the very cutting edge of the contemporary art world. It has a glass facade and contains several exhibition rooms, a café and shop. Take a look at quality work from various different artistic collections. In the '"Chamber of Wonders'" look at a collection of art, scientific instruments and bizarre or exciting items from the Renaissance and Baroque periods such as a coconut cup belonging to Alexander von Humboldt and a taxidermy Nile crocodile.
Take the S-Bahn line S1, S2 or S25 or Oranienburger Strasse, and from there it''s just seconds to the Kennedys exhibition. Alternatively, take the U6 underground line to Oranienburger Tor. If you have a Berlin WelcomeCard, you will get 30% off the admission price. For groups, guided tours can be arranged and a reduced price applies for groups over 10 people. Workshops are also run for school groups, details of which can be found on the museum website.

2014,Grünauer Wassersportmuseum (Water Sports Museum ...,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/grunauer-wassersportmuseum-water-sports-museum,"
ATTENTION: Due to the refurbishment of the regatta grandstand the Grünauer Watersport Museum is currently closed. It is expected to open in 2019 with a new permanent exhibition. 
To the south-east of Berlin, on the location of the 1938 Olympic Regatta, is the Grünauer Wassersportmuseum. The museum covers an area of 350 square metres and has 200 exhibits. These exhibits will take you on a journey through time, starting with the first rowing clubs on the Dahme and Spree rivers, through to sporting achievements at the highest level. Exhibits include boats from the 1936 Olympic Games. The exhibition also includes advertising posters and plaques from that time, as well as original medals and sporting badges.
The history of water sports in Berlin starts in 1835 when a group of yachtsmen get together. In 1868, the first regatta from Bammelecke to Köpenick is organised. The first rowing club is founded in 1876, and just four years later, Grünau has its own regatta circuit. This place rapidly becomes the centre of rowing in Berlin. In 1925, there are already over 100 rowing clubs. In 1936, Grünau plays host to the rowers of the Olympic Games. After World War II, the East German sporting federations carry on with the tradition of rowing. Towards the end of the GDR era, some of their most famous water sportsmen train here.

Starting in 1980, rower and coach Werner Philipp starts to collect exhibits from which the Grünauer Wassersportmuseum develops. In 1994, the city of Berlin takes over management of the collection. The museum gives an interesting perspective on the development of rowing in Berlin and puts it in political context. The museum explores the importance of Jewish clubs and workshops in the 20th century and aims not only to promote the sport but to highlight its social, political and regional role.
The museum has its home in a clubhouse beneath the stands of the Regatta stadium in Grünau. Your visit leads you through bright exhibition rooms designed to showcase each individual item. There are various canoes, rowing boats, kayaks and dragon boats from previous eras of rowing history. Particularly worth seeing are the rowing boats from the 1936 Olympics, the European and World Championships and GDR national competitions. See what remains of a famous German sporting monument which is inaugurated in honour of Emperor Wilhelm I in 1898 and destroyed by the GDR government in 1973. Items saved from the destruction can be seen here.
We recommend the historic Gaststätte Schmetterlingshorst restaurant on the Dahme river at Köpenick for a great excursion. In the 19th century, water sportsmen were already coming here to recover. Today you''ll find an extensive butterfly collection with around 3,500 specimens. Also worth a visit is the Waterworks museum at Müggelsee. The Wasserwerk is the most modern of its type in Europe at the time of its commissioning in 1893. You can see fascinating and well-preserved pumping stations and the original machine hall at the coplex today.
Take S-Bahn lines S46, S8 or S85 to Grünau station and walk for around 15 minutes to the Grünauer Wassersportmuseum. Alternatively, take 68 tram. The museum is only open between April and October, and out of season tours are available on request. Small donations are required for guided tours.

2016,Museum of Silence (Museum der Stille) | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/museum-silence-museum-der-stille,"
The Museum of Silence is possibly one of the most extraordinary museums in Berlin. It was conceived by the Russian painter Nikolai Makarov as an oasis of tranquillity in the heart of the eternally busy district of Berlin-Mitte. On arrival, you find yourself standing in front of a Wilhelminian style house. You cannot look in as the windows are covered for privacy. On entering the building, find yourself in rooms with earthy red walls and ceilings. Sound-absorbing carpets swallow all noise. You are alone in silence – and with works of art.
Nikolai Makarov''s paintings look almost transparent and calm. Looking at them you can feel relaxed, as if there were only the here and now, nothing else. Founded by Makarov, the Museum of Silence is inspired by the famous Mark Rothko Chapel in Houston. Contemplation, calm, meditation, reflection, silence and depth - all these moods arise in you when you spend time here. This is a good alternative to stress and inner tension. For Makarov himself, it offers a feeling of infinity. In the first room, see white platforms with seven architectural models: ideas for further places of silence by architects like Stephan Braunfels, Michael Marshall and Franco Stella. Sergei Tchoban, for example, imagines a completely round room which looks lit like a crystal ball. Maybe you will be able to enter these unusual places soon. Go further into the heart of the museum - the Space of Silence. Here the artist displays only one picture: an abstract landscape in grisaille technique. In front of this painting, which occupies the whole wall, stands a simple wooden bench. The light is dimmed which evokes shadows that become part of the artwork.
It is a 300 metre walk from the Museum of Silence to the KW Institute for Contemporary Art. The art historian and cultural manager Klaus Biesenbach founded the gallery in the 1990s, in a former margarine factory. The museum showcases the latest trends of the world''s contemporary art scene with changing exhibitions. Commissioned works are created in workshops here where artists experiment with new styles. In 1996, the KW launched the Berlin Biennial for Contemporary Art, now a cultural centrepiece. Since 1969, the nbk Neuer Berliner Kunstverein has also devoted itself to modern art. It is a ten minute walk from the Museum of Silence to nbk in Chausseestraße. Young artists from Berlin in particular exhibit in the rooms of the Kunstverein, including students and scholarship holders. A special feature is the Artothek – art to take away. Here you can borrow one of the 4,000 art works for your living room wall for up to six months. In addition, there is a collection of international video art of all genres. With over 1,600 works, it is one of the largest in Germany. Well-known artists of the Artothek''s early phase are Bruce Naumann and Nam June Paik.
The Museum der Stille can easily be reached by public transport. Take the U6 underground to the Oranienburger Tor stop. Alternatively, take the S-Bahn S1, S2 or S25 to Oranienburger Straße. From both stations you walk only about 15 minutes on foot. For drivers, the car park in Luisenstrasse is closest. Entrance to the museum is free.

2021,Buchstabenmuseum (Museum of Letters) - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/buchstabenmuseum-museum-letters,"
This unique collection from the world of letters displays more than 1,000 examples of letters, logos and signs. Most of the exhibits come from the Berlin cityscape including, for example, the letters “HAUP” from the former central station, today’s Ostbahnhof. There is also an “E” from scenes of Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds” on display. This letter was the only one to survive the explosion of the Le Gamaar cinema in the film’s final showdown. There are also treasures from all over Germany, Austria and Bulgaria in the collection. The letters are full sized and tell a story of the city, its transition and nostalgic brand names.
The founders of the museum have been saving letters, symbols and adverts for posterity since 2005. The first exhibition in 2008 contains exhibits weighing up to 100 kilograms and 2.5 metres in height. The museum has moved several times since then but is now in its permanent home in the Hansaviertel. The lettering “Buchstabenmuseum” is immediately seen as a neon blue display. Many of the exhibition pieces also glow in neon. Other exhibits are filigree, from wood or stainless steel. While they previously gave the Berlin cityscape and other areas a special flair, now they are on display in the Museum of Letters. For example, you will find the “Schuhe” neon sign from Alt-Tegel and the curved „Zierfische” that adorned the pet shop on Karl-Marx-Allee at Frankfurter Tor. While the letters in the cityscape often fall way, they are restored and given a second life in the museum. Here you can learn of the background, individual techniques and fonts.
The Akademie der Künste is located in the immediate vicinity of the Buchstabenmuseum. Regular exhibitions and events are held there on current topics from art and politics. Only around 20 minutes'' walk away is the graffiti museum in the Arte Local in Turmstraße. Berlin itself is one of the largest street art galleries in the world – and this is now, for the first time, in a fixed location. Haus der Kulturen der Welt at Tiergarten is an established address for international art. The '"Pregnant Oyster'", as it is also called, is a stage for high-profile events focusing on science, politics, culture and the media. The Bauhaus Archive is located at the other end of the Tiergarten. You can visit the world’s largest collection of famous design and architecture schools in the Museum für Gestaltung. The exhibits reveal the worldwide influence of the Bauhaus to this day. Visit the Werkbundarchiv, also known as Museum der Dinge, near Kottbusser Tor. Here you will learn everything about the Viennese union of the same name from 1907. The focus is on fashionable industrial products of the 20th and 21st centuries – presented in innovative showcases in a former workshop.
The museum is located in one of the arcs under the S-Bahn station at Bellevue, directly in the Hansaviertel. To get to the station, you can take the S-Bahn S5, S7 and S75. Alternatively, take the U9 underground line to Hansaplatz, which is 500 metres away. The museum is currently closed for renovation.

This is the main difference between the Me Collectors Room and other private collections open to the public. me Collectors Room Berlin / Olbricht Foundation has teamed up with freshmuseum to develop the ‘me Berlin’ app that gives visitors a free augmented-reality tour of the exhibitions. Before their visit, people can download the app onto their smartphones (Android or iPhones). The mobile device automatically recognizes which artwork the visitor is standing in front of, and calls up information pertaining to that exhibit or room. The tour is available in German or English.

2029,Hanf Museum Berlin (Berlin Hemp Museum) | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/hanf-museum-berlin-berlin-hemp-museum,"
Located in the centre of Berlin, in the picturesque district of Nikolai, is the Hemp Museum. The exhibition vividly describes the age-old use of hemp in various industries. Installations and displays illustrate, across approximately 250 square metres, the uses people have found for this versatile crop: from textile and insulation material to medicine. Discover the benefits hemp has brought to people throughout history, as well as its psychoactive effects.
No other museum in Germany hosts an exhibition dedicated to the hemp plant. In the winter of 1994, H.A.N.F. e. V. opens in the Nikolai district as part of an initiative to reintegrate hemp into economical use. Your journey of discovery begins in front of a small, neat town house. Inside the museum''s eight rooms, you will find exciting information and exhibits that explain the versatility of hemp. Your tour continues in an almost homey atmosphere: you learn about the hemp seeds that were discovered in pre-Christian graves. In the cultural history zone, you discover how Hemp strings play an important role in ancient China. Hemp is also critical to textile and material production. Locate the old spinning wheel on which plant fibres are made into threads and transformed into items of clothing, ropes and mats. The Museum''s '"Green Cabinet'" exhibits hemp plants themselves. Take a close-up look at the inconspicuous and yet exceptional specimens growing there. The next exhibition room presents cosmetics, hemp paper, medical preparations and hemp-based oils. The art gallery showcases the use of the hemp plant as a stimulant. These images by self-confessed consumers from past and present are attention-grabbing to say the least. One small exhibit shows historical smoking pipes from turn-of-the-century Vienna. Finally, the adjacent room revolves around Rastafarians and the Middle East. Your tour culminates in the cellar where a small café offers THC-free cannabis specialities such as hemp tea and a regular music and culture programme. In addition, there are books and magazines on the topic.
Also located in the Nikolai quarter, only a few steps from the Hanf Museum Berlin, is the oldest church in the capital. This is the city''s reconstructed Medieval nucleus. The former church now serves as an ecclesiastical, construction and urban history museum. The permanent exhibition presents the origin of the building '"from the city floor to the top of the double spire'". Another distinctive feature of the Nikolai district is the magnificent Ephraim-Palais from the 18th century. The three floors of this rococo building show rotating special exhibitions about Berlin''s art and cultural history. The Stadtmuseum also displays its graphical collection here.
You can reach the Hanf Museum Berlin via the U and S-Bahn lines S5, S7, U5, U8 and S75 to Berlin Alexanderplatz. From here, it''s only about 600 metres walk to the museum. Alternatively, you can use the underground station Klosterstraße on the U2 line. The M48 bus also stops at the Nikolai district. Entrance is free for children under ten years of age. Groups of over six people and anyone using the Berlin Pass receive discounts. Throughout the museum, you will find prompts to listen to an electronic guide, which you can pick up at the entrance. Groups of under 10 people pay an additional 5 euros.

2032,Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr - visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/militarhistorisches-museum-der-bundeswehr,"

  The story of the Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr is told via gigantic artefacts such as aircrafts, radars and launch sites.
  

The Bundeswehr Military History Museum is located directly on a (former) airfield - Gatow in west Berlin. Germany''s military aviation history between 1884 and the present is the focus. Insights into the development of planes and helicopters over this period await your discovery here. More than 100 flying vehicles occupy an extensive outdoor display area. Examples include the Interceptor fighter aircraft MiG-17 from 1959, military trucks, uniforms and personal equipment.
In 1987, the Bundeswehr acquires many of its 600,000 exhibition pieces from a private collection. The museum first opens its doors in 1995, allowing visitors to explore through thematically organised curation. The site is open air and also encompasses the tower building and two hangars. On the runway, the enormous aeroplanes, helicopters and air defence systems astound. In Hangar 3 (currently closed) you will encounter air and ground support equipment dating back to 1884 and a replica triplane fighter aircraft Fokker Dr.I., an impressive insight into the life of soldiers in the tower building. Explore their personal estates and documents in the display cases. Models of the Gatower Airport during the Berlin Airlift are also on display here. Take a tour of the Bundeswehr Luftwaffe since 1945 in Hangar 7. Exhibits showcase the everyday life of Luftwaffe soldiers such as German air traffic control. View informative footage in the cinema.
A former American interception building intercepts you on top of a man-made mountain (Teufelsberg) in nearby Grunewald. Take a 90-minute tour of the dome and learn about its military use. The mountain is the second highest peak of the capital and is made from debris from the World War II bombings. Up here, you have an exceptional view of Grunewald forest. In 15 minutes, you can walk from Teufelsberg to a Conservation Centre. Hike through themed open-air gardens (for example, rock garden or organic garden) and learn about conservation. Water is an important theme: amidst the gardens, Berlin''s oldest waterworks are preserved.
As a motorist, you can park for free directly in front of the museum entrance. But it is also reached comfortably by public transport: the BVG bus 125 stops at Seekorso or Kurpromenade, both a 10 minute walk from the museum. Cyclists can take advantage of the BVG ferry F10 from Wannsee to Alt-Kladow. Admission is generally free of charge. Join in the public guided tours on weekends.
There are guided tours on request for families. Without an appointment, you can borrow special audio guides. Due to the war and military topics, it makes sense for children visiting to the museum to exceed the age of nine.

  The JULIA STOSCHEK COLLECTION is a private collection of contemporary international art with a focus on time-based media.
  

Founded in 2007, the private collection boasts over 700 works by around 200 primarily European and US artists. The various substantive aspects covered by the collection are presented and documented in regular temporary exhibitions and publications. The steadily growing collection concentrates conceptually above all on the moving image in art from the 1960s to the present day and straddles various disciplines: video, single and multiple projections of analog and digital film material, multimedia environments as well as computer and Internet- based installations, but also ephemeral art forms, such as performances. To supplement the main Düsseldorf location, starting in June 2016 a temporary space will open to the public in Berlin. The exhibition area covers a full 2,500 sq.m. and is to be found in Berlin’s Mitte district at Leipziger Strasse 60 – in the building complex that formerly housed the Czech Cultural Center in East Germany. Most recently, the Konzulát club and the office community Konzulát-Studios was based here. By opening the satellite in Berlin, JULIA STOSCHEK COLLECTION becomes the first private collection in Germany to have two publicly accessible locations at once - in Düsseldorf and Berlin. With works by: Ed Atkins, Neïl Beloufa, Hannah Black, Ian Cheng, Loretta Fahrenholz, Cao Fei, Melanie Gilligan, Camille Henrot, Juliana Huxtable, K-HOLE, Josh Kline, Helen Marten, Jon Rafman, Rachel Rose, Timur Si-Qin, Frances Stark, Hito Steyerl, Britta Thie, Wu Tsang, Amir Yatziv Public guided tours were offerd every Sunday at 5pm. 10,- Euro / person admission fee.

  Jagdschloss Grunewald is located next to Grunewaldsee. It houses works by Lucas Cranach and is the oldest Renaissance palace hall in Berlin. 
  

The hunting lodge is not only Berlin’s oldest palace building, but also has a unique Renaissance hall. And in its lakeside and woodland surroundings, it’s not just a place for aristocrats to enjoy after hunting. Take a look for yourself at Jagdschloss Grunewald.
In what is now the borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf, directly by the lake called Grunewaldsee, Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg set up a hunting lodge, and his mistress lived there permanently for several years. In 1542, work began on the “Jagdschloss Zum Grünen Wald”. The water castle in the early Renaissance style was designed by the master builder Caspar Theiss. Over the years, it lost its character as a water castle as the moats were filled and the lake was lowered. The main building was constructed on two storeys with tower-like corner wings facing the lake. A relief sculpture of a stag decorates the entrance, showing that the palace is a hunting lodge.
The palace was not converted to a baroque building until 1699 under Friedrich Wilhelm. King Friedrich I of Prussia had the façade painted a brilliant white, and also added many baroque elements between 1705 and 1708: decorated stucco ceilings and fireplaces to keep warm in winter. The doors and windows were also modernised and an additional storey built.
Under Frederick the Great and his successor Friedrich Wilhelm II, the palace became less significant, as the Hohenzollerns were not keen hunters. Around 1800, it was given the name it still has today. Not until the 1820s did regular hunting events revive the lodge and the surrounding area. But everyone was talking about it after 1891, when Kaiser Wilhelm II turned it into a pleasure palace.
In keeping with the spirit of the Renaissance, Elector Joachim commissioned portraits, passion scenes and paintings from the renowned artist Lucas Cranach the Elder, and later his son, Lucas Cranach the Younger. Jagdschloss Grunewald now has a permanent exhibition with the works of these important painters. Another exhibition features portraits of the rulers of Brandenburg and Prussia, and many historical royal hunting trophies.
The lodge and its grounds have been the location for many well-known films and series, including Creature with the Blue Hand, Wild Geese 2 and Schloss Einstein.

2047,Teufelsberg - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/teufelsberg,"

  A listening station during the Cold War, today, a popular place for a day out in the Grunewald. Enjoy a fantastic view of Berlin from Teufelsberg! 
  

Look to the east and see the TV Tower and cathedral sparling in the setting sun. 114 metres up on a hill of rubble, the view of Germany’s capital is uniquely beautiful. Teufelsberg played the role of its life in the drama known as the Cold War – as an American listening station.
In the early 20th century the area was covered in bogs and mud, but that all changed when the Nazis came to power. As part of the plans for Germania – Hitler’s vision for a completely renewed Berlin – work began on the construction of a university faculty for military technology, but it was never completed, and destroyed in the war. After the war, trucks brought rubble from the rest of the devastated city to the site near Heerstraße and it soon piled up to become the highest point in West Berlin. The dumping stopped in 1972, trees were planted to make the man-made hill more attractive, and a ski slope was built complete with a ski lift, a ski jump and a toboggan run.
The Americans also soon recognised the usefulness of the artificial hill. From the 1950s onwards, antennas and radomes were erected on its two hilltops for espionage and intercepting communications. Huge dishes were built for intercepting, listening to and jamming radio signals from the Eastern Bloc.The field station was used by the American forces until the end of the Cold War in 1989. The four striking radomes are what still gives Teufelsberg its mysterious aura today, because not until 2020 when the archives are opened will the public be able to find out find out what was listened to, and what methods were used.
After the end of the Cold War and the departure of the allied forces, the complex was used for air traffic control until 1999, when the city government sold it. However, all the plans for a new use came to nothing. In 2007, the American film director David Lynch wanted to buy the complex in in order to set up a “Vedic Peace University” with the controversial Maharishi Foundation.
Today, tours are available where you can view the remains of the complex with its five large radar domes. The listening station is now probably the most well-known of Berlin’s formerly secret sites. The ruins of the station and its satellite dishes are covered in graffiti and exude a morbid charm. You can still feel the spirit of the Cold War which once permeated the city.

Since reunification, Teufelsberg has become a popular destination for day-trippers. In winter it’s the perfect place for tobogganing and mass snowball fights. In summer, Berliners gather here to have a picnic and enjoy the beautiful sunset – as well as the nearby Teufelssee. All year round, people fly kites and go paragliding, mountain-biking and hiking in the Grunewald forest. Sailing boats glide over the Havel in summer. The Havelhöhenweg, the footpath along the Havel, goes all the way to the Wannsee open-air lido in Zehlendorf and affords beautiful views of the river and lakes.

  Located directly on Potsdamer Platz, the Panoramapunkt offers you a magnificent view of the city and features an exhibition on the history of the square.
  
Tickets
The Panoramapunkt viewing platform – directly on Potsdamer Platz – gives you a view of of many different landmarks. From up here you can see modern architecture and historical highlights of the city. As well as the panorama café and an exhibition, the journey up is a special experience.
With the fastest elevator in Europe, you’ll be up on the viewing platform on the 25th floor before you know it. In just 20 seconds, you’re 100 metres above Potsdamer Platz. The Panoramapunkt is at the top of the Kollhoff Tower. The TV Tower at Alexanderplatz, the Berlin Cathedral on Museum Island or the Bundeskanzleramt and the Gedächtniskirche – there is (almost) nothing you can’t see from up here.
The building with the brick façade was completed in 1999 and is part of the Quartier Potsdamer Platz. Its famous neighbours include the DB Tower and the Sony Center – both of which can be seen from the viewing platform. On the 24th and 25th floors of the Kollhoff Towers you will find the viewing platform, a panorama café with an open-air terrace sunroof and an exhibition.
The open-air exhibition Berliner Blicke on the 24th floor features pictures and an audio guide to present the history of Potsdamer Platz. The exhibition inspires you to imagine what Potsdamer Platz must have been like in the past: busy and bustling – almost like now – in the early 20th century; the rubble and desolation from the end of the Second World War; the Berlin Wall, which passed right through Potsdamer Platz and divided the city and all of Germany. The revival finally caught up with Potsdamer Platz in the 1990s. With your own eyes, you can compare it to today and see how it changed during its history. Potsdamer Platz is now characterised by modern high-rise buildings, business people in suits and ties, and crowds of tourists.
The panorama café with its open-air terrace takes you back to the 1930s. The furnishings are reminiscent of the plain, elegant style of those times. With glass windows all round, snacks, coffee and cakes are available. The café is the ideal place to enjoy the sunset over the city.

2062,Funkturm - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/funkturm,"

  In the years when the city was divided, the Funkturm was a striking symbol of West Berlin, and today it is still a popular attraction with its panorama view of the city.
  

Attention: The Funkturm is closed until 10 September due to renovation work.
The Parisians have the Eiffel Tower – and the Berliners have the Funkturm. You might not have heard of it, because it’s not quite as famous, but it’s still worth a visit. See for yourself what the Eiffel Tower’s little cousin has to offer.   
It took two whole years to build the broadcasting tower. Its steel framework construction is reminiscent of France’s most famous landmark, because the plans of the architect Heinrich Straumer were inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris. In 1926, by now nicknamed “Langer Lulatsch” (the lanky lad), it was opened in time for the 3rd German Radio Exhibition. The world’s first television picture was broadcast here the same year. The next première was in 1929 with the first radio transmissions.
In 1930, one of the world’s most famous physicists stood at the foot of the steel structure and held the opening speech for the 7th German Radio Exhibition. It was the genius Albert Einstein, who did not want to miss out on a visit to the Funkturm. It’s hard now to imagine now how important radio was in those days.
In the following years, fairs and exhibitions became more important. Even today, the Funkturm is surrounded by Berlin’s biggest exhibition grounds. In 1935, a fire in the exhibition halls destroyed parts of the tower. But not even wartime bombs could bring down the tower – even though it only stood on three legs for a while.
The 600-tonne giant was repaired and restored after the war. Every twelve years it gets a new coat of metal paint, making it another 9 kilograms heavier. In strong winds, the tip of the tower can move up to 40 centimetres. But don’t worry: it’s never broken off. 
These days the Langer Lulatsch is used as a transmitter for the local police and mobile phone network. But it’s also a place where tourists come for a bird’s-eye view of the city. The Funkturm is 150 metres high, and you can go all the way up to the viewing platform at 126 metres, where you are rewarded by a fantastic view of the western city centre. Only 287 steps up from the ground is the restaurant platform, where you can take a break and build up strength for the remaining 360 steps to the viewing platform. If you’re already worn out from all your sightseeing in Berlin, you can always take the glass lift. 
Fancy an oxtail soup or a fillet of plaice 55 metres above the ground? Just take a look at the lunch menu at the Funkturm restaurant. With a different themed gourmet buffet every month, there’s something for connoisseurs in the evening too. The Art Nouveau décor will make you feel like you’re dining in the Roaring Twenties.

2063,Tour 32 - A Cycling Tour Victory Column | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/tour-32-cycling-tour-victory-column,"
This cycling tour starts at Budapester Straße 2, directly in front of the Hotel Intercontinental. From the front of the hotel, ride to your left. Cross the Landwehrkanal and continue riding as the street turns into Stülerstraße. Ride for an additional two short blocks until you come to Hofjägerallee, where you will take a left into the Großer Tiergarten park. Ride straight ahead on Hofjägerallee until you come to the Siegessäule (Victory Column).
This column stands in the middle of Großer Stern, a busy roundabout. At the top of the column is the golden Victoria, nicknamed '"Goldelse'" by Berliners. The column was erected to celebrate the wars in the 1860s-1870s that led to German unification under Otto von Bismarck.
If you like, you might want to climb the 285 steps to the top of the Siegessäule and enjoy a panoramic view over the city.
Follow the roundabout to the second right and turn onto Spreeweg. On your left you will see the Bundespräsidentialamt (the office of the German President), followed shortly by Schloß Bellevue, the President''s official residence. The palace and its garden are closed except for a few days of the year for security reasons.
Just before the bridge over the Spree, take a right onto John-Foster-Dulles Allee. Ride for about 700 metres along the Spree until you come to the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (House of World Cultures), nicknamed by locals '"the pregnant oyster'". A convention centre until 1989, the building is now an international centre for the contemporary arts. Continue along John-Foster-Dulles-Allee.
Take a break on the terrace of this restaurant in Haus der Kulturen der Welt and enjoy a unique view of the Spree.
On the left, you will pass the Carillon, where carilloneur Jeffrey Bossin offers concerts on Sundays. Stay on John-Foster-Dulles-Allee for another 200 metres until the road curves to the left and becomes Scheidemannstraße. After crossing the next intersection, the Platz der Republik will be on your left.
The Platz der Republik (Republic Square) is in front of the Reichstag Building, the current seat of the German Bundestag. The square was laid out in the first third of the eighteenth century and has seen the many vicissitudes of German history. Continue riding to the front of the Reichstag.
The Reichstag, too, has seen much of Germany''s turbulent history. Built in 1894, famously facing away from the Kaiser''s centre of power further to the east, this building housed the German Reichstag (Parliament) through the loss of World War I, the turbulent post-war Weimar Republic and the rise of Adolf Hitler. The building was very badly damaged during the Second World War and was marooned in an isolated corner of West Berlin along the Wall during the country''s division. Since reunification, the building has been restored and has been the seat of the German Bundestag since 1999.
This fine restaurant is a great place to take a refreshing break with some delicious food and drink and a unique panoramic view from the roof of the Reichstag. It''s best to book a table in advance and be sure to bring your ID for the security checks to enter the building.
Continue on the south side of the Reichstag and take a right onto Ebertstraße. In just a few metres, you will be in in front of the Brandenburg Gate, Berlin''s most famous landmark. The gate was built in 1791 and was once the western border of the city and was surrounded by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989. What was once a symbol of German division now stands for German reunification. Continue on Ebertstraße to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.
Alight from your bicycle and lock it up and take the time to walk through this field of stelae, 2,711 concrete pillars. This is the only way to experience the unusual design of this unique memorial dedicated to the six million Jewish people killed in the Holocaust. Continue riding south (to the left) on Ebertstraße for about a block and take a right onto Lennéstraße.
Follow Lennéstraße along the southern edge of the Großer Tiergarten as the road becomes Tiergartenstraße. Continue riding on Tiergartenstraße and on the left you will pass many of the foreign embassies in Germany''s capital. Some of the buildings are old and some are newly constructed, including some unusual buildings in the architectural style of the embassy''s home country. After about 1.4 kilometres, you will cross Hofjägerallee and continue straight onto Stülerstraße. Take a right at the next corner onto Rauchstraße.
Rauchstraße terminates at Drakestraße, where you will take a right and ride for two short blocks as the road curves to the left. Take a left onto Lichtensteinallee. On the right-hand side of the road is the Café am Neuen See with its beer garden, a nice place to take a break, especially in the summer.
Retrace your route back to Drakestraße, but continue past Rauchstraße to where the road runs into Corneliusstraße, where you will take a left. At the next corner, take a right over the Landwehrkanal bridge and you''ll now be on Budapest Straße. At No. 2, you''ve reached your destination."

2067,Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/districts/friedrichshain-kreuzberg,"
As anyone from Kreuzberg will tell you, this district is not just the coolest in Berlin, but the hippest location in the entire universe. Kreuzberg has long been famed for its diverse cultural life, its experimental alternative lifestyles and the powerful spell it exercises on young people from across Germany. In 2001, Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain were merged to form one administrative borough. When it comes to club culture, Friedrichshain is now out in front – with southern Friedrichshain particularly ranked as home to the highest density of clubs in the city.

2069,Fliegeberg | visitBerlin.de,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/fliegeberg,"
The dream of flying led Berlin’s Otto Lilienthal to become one of the greatest pioneers of aviation. Lilienthal built flying machines which enabled him to take to the air and fulfil his dream.
Lilienthal experimented with his first flying machines on various hills around Berlin. Near his house in Lichterfelde, where his brother Gustav built ornate villas, he had an artificial hill built in 1894 from rubble. The hill was nearly 60 metres high and Lilienthal used it to test his gliders – performing over a thousand flights, managing distances of more than 80 metres.
When the park was redesigned between 1928 and 1933, the architects cut down the trees on the hill and created terraces leading up it. You can easily climb up the steps to the top of the hill and enjoy the sweeping view.
A round pillared hall on the top of the hill commemorates Otto Lilienthal’s dream of flying. The bronze globe inside is a replica, because the original one was melted down during the war.
Every year in the park, the Fliegefest is held in honour of Lilienthal and his pioneering deeds.
Lilienthal crashed in 1896 during a test flight on the Gollenberg near Stölln and died from his serious injuries. His grave is at the cemetery in Lankwitz. The inscription “Sacrifices have to be made” was added to the grave in 1940. According to legend, these were Lilienthal’s last words, although eye-witnesses reported otherwise.

While Otto was taking to the skies, his brother Gustav was busy building magnificent pseudo-mediaeval houses in the new villa district of Lichterfelde West. Otto Lilienthal’s house at Boothstraße 17 no longer exists. Take a stroll through the area past Tuscan mansions, great houses with pointed arches and ornamental bridges, and villas with gables and turrets. A good place to start your walk is Lichterfelde West S-Bahn station. When you pass the colourful Emisch-Haus with its painted religious motifs and the Tuscan-style Villa Holzhüter, you come to Kommandantenstraße with its imposing villas. On Weddigenweg and Paulinenstraße you can marvel at the Tudor-style houses with their drawbridges, merlons and towerlets.

2078,Skywalk Marzahn - visitBerlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/skywalk-marzahn,"

  It’s not for those afraid of heights: on the Skywalk in Marzahn, you are 70 metres above the ground, at the top of the high-rise blocks, where you can enjoy the spectacular view.  
  

A skywalk with a difference – across the rooftops of the city. If ever there’s anything new to discover, then Berlin’s the place you’re most likely to find it. From the viewing platforms, you can see right to the city centre.
The Grand Canyon isn’t the only place that boasts a skywalk – Berlin has one too. But instead of looking down into a deep gorge, you can see across the rooftops of high-rise blocks and the whole of Berlin. The degewo Skywalk on Marzahner Promenade opened in autumn 2015. The idea for a skywalk was initiated by one of Berlin’s housing associations and was funded by the city government as an urban development project.
70 metres above the ground you are no longer on the roof of a typical GDR high-rise block in the north-east of Berlin, but directly over Marzahner Promenade, the centre of the district of Marzahn. From up here, you literally get a different perspective of the borough of Marzahn-Hellersdorf. The Kienberg, the site of the international garden show and the windmill in what used to be the village of Alt-Marzahn are all nearby and particularly easy to spot. Further on towards the horizon you can see the TV Tower, Schönefeld airport and Müggelsee in good weather. Beyond that, you can also admire the Brandenburg countryside from your lofty vantage point.
You can only go on the viewing platform in the company of a Skywalk guide. The hour-long guided tour is free, but you do have to book it at the degewo customer centre. The mesh floors give you an almost unrestricted view below you. You need to be comfortable with heights to really enjoy the view. Sturdy shoes are recommended for walking on the mesh floors.
The residential high-rise block where the spectacular viewing platform is built is 23 storeys high and on Raoul-Wallenberg-Straße, which you can reach on S-Bahn line 7. From the station, it’s only 10 minutes’ walk to the Skywalk and its unique view.
